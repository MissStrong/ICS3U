### Console

We can use the console to write one-line programs. It will print the result, if there is one (you don't need to write `print()`). Strings will show up with single quotation marks, even if you used double quotation marks.

```
> "hello" + "world"
'helloworld'
> "yo" * 3
'yoyoyo'
```

The console can be used to temporarily store values. This data get deleted when you hit *Run â–¶*.

```
> x = "hi" # this is just a variable assignment; there's no result to print
> x
'hi'
> y
NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```

To go back to something we previously wrote, we can use the up arrow to nagivate though our previous commands from the same session.
