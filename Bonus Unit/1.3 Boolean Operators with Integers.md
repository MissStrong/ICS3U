### Boolean Operators with Integers

Recall that `or` and `and` are boolean operators that take boolean expressions. What do you think would happen if we used numeric values instead?

```python
print(3 or 5) # what do you think gets printed?
print(3 and 5) # what do you think gets printed?
```

We might think that the numbers get converted into booleans. If that were the case, `3 or 5` would be equivalent to `True or True` which is `True` and `3 and 5` would be equivalent to `True and True` which is also `True`.

Here's what we actually get:

```python
print(3 or 5) # prints 3
print(3 and 5) # prints 5
```

This is because `or` and `and` actually return the last evaluated argument, which is not necessarily a boolean.

```python
print(0 or 5) # prints 5
print(0 and 5) # prints 0
print(False or 7) # prints 7
print(True and 0) # prints 0
```

Here is [the documentation for `or` and `and`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations).
