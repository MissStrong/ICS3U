### Storing Variables

Programs store variables in **memory**. Each location in memory has an **address**, typically represented in hexadecimal.

To find the address of a variable in Python, we can use `id()`. This returns the number as a base 10 value, but we can convert it to hexadecimal using `hex()`.

```python
x = 3
print(hex(id(x))  # prints the address where 3 is stored (e.g. 0x7fdc369ef720)
```

### Mutable Versus Immutable Variables

If a variable *moves addresses* when it is assigned a new value, its data type is **immutable**. "Immutable" means "can't change", and in this case it's the value stored in memory that can't change. Immutable data types include all the primitive data types:`int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`, as well as several non-primitive data types, including `tuple`, `range`, and `decimal`.

```python
x = 3
print(hex(id(x)))  # prints the address where 3 is stored (e.g. 0x7f10fda70720)

x = x + 1
print(hex(id(x)))  # prints the address where 4 is stored (e.g. 0x7f10fda70740)
```

Notice that the address of `x` changed when its value was reassigned. This behaviour happens with all primitive data types in Python.

If a variable does not move addresses when it is assigned a new value, its data type is **mutable**. This includes `list`, `dict`, and `set`. 

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
print(hex(id(lst))) # prints the address where [1, 2, 3] is stored (e.g. 0x7efdf846d600)

lst.append(4)
print(hex(id(lst))) # prints the address where [1, 2, 3, 4] is stored (e.g. 0x7efdf846d600)
```

Notice that the address of `lst` did not change when the list was updated. 

### Aliasing

**Aliasing** occurs when when two variable names point to the same location in memory. In other words, they can be used interchangeably. This can be an issue with mutable data types.

```python
lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = lst1
lst1.append(4)

print(lst1)  # prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(lst2)  # also prints [1, 2, 3, 4], not [1, 2, 3]
```

In this example `lst1` and `lst2` are **aliases** of each other. Whenever we update `lst1`, we also update `lst2`, and vice versa. We can confirm this by checking their locations in memory (they will be the same address).

If we don't want this to happen, we can call the `list()` function to make a new list in at a new location in memory.

```python
lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = list(lst1)  # makes a new list at a new location in memory
lst1.append(4)

print(lst1) # prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(lst2) # prints [1, 2, 3], not [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

We can also the `.copy()` method from `list`.

```python
lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = lst1.copy()  # makes a new list at a new location in memory
lst1.append(4)

print(lst1) # prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(lst2) # prints [1, 2, 3], not [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
