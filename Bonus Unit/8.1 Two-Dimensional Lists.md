### 2D Lists

In Python, the term **2D list** is used for lists whose *elements* are 1D lists. Each inner list represents a row in a 2D grid.

The following grid can be represented using the 2D list `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

### Initializing 2D Lists

To initialize the 2D list above, we can do the following:

```python
row0 = [1, 2, 3]
row1 = [4, 5, 6]
row2 = [7, 8, 9]
grid = [row0, row1, row2]
```

### Accessing Cells in a 2D List

We can access an individual cell in a 2D list by its row number and column number. 

Don't forget that the first row is row 0 and the first column is column 0.

```python
row0 = [1, 2, 3]
row1 = [4, 5, 6]
row2 = [7, 8, 9]
grid = [row0, row1, row2]

print(grid[0][1])  # prints 2 (row 0, column 1)
print(grid[1][2])  # prints 6 (row 1, column 2)
print(grid[3][0])  # prints 7 (row 2, column 0)
```

### Searching Through a 2D List

We can use a nested `for` loop to go through all the cells in a 2D list.

```python
row0 = [1, 2, 3]
row1 = [4, 5, 6]
row2 = [7, 8, 9]
grid = [row0, row1, row2]

def find_number(grid, num):
  """Returns True if num is in the grid and False otherwise."""
  for row in range(len(grid)):  # the length of the grid is the number of rows
    for col in range(len(grid[0])):  # the length of a row is the number of columns
      if num == grid[row][col]:
        return True  # the item has been found
  return False  # there are no more cells left to check

print(find_number(grid, 4)) # prints True
print(find_number(grid, 12)) # prints False
```
