### Custom Methods

We can override built-in methods in custom classes, but we can also make our own custom methods too. The syntax is the same as any other function.

```python
class Enemy:
    """An enemy in an adventure game."""

    def __init__(self, name, attacks, health):
        """The constructor takes a name, a list of attacks, and a number of health points."""
        self.name = name
        self.attacks = attacks
        self.health = health

    def attack(self, attack_name):  # custom method for an ememy attack
        """Prints a message indicating an enemy attack."""
        assert attack_name in self.attacks  # ensures that the attack is valid
        print(f"{self.name} used {attack_name} attack!")

    def take_damage(self, damage_points):  # custom method for reducing the health points
        """Reduces the enemy's health by damage_points points and ensures it doesn't go below zero."""
        assert 0 <= damage_points  # if damage_points is negative they'd be gaining health points
        self.health -= damage_points
        if self.health < 0:  # health can't be negative
            self.health = 0
```

We call custom methods using dot notation, just like any other method.

```python
final_boss = Enemy("Ganon", ["sword", "ice blocks", "tornado", "earthquake"], 100) # Creates an enemy object
final_boss.attack("sword") # prints "Ganon uses sword attack!"
final_boss.take_damage(10) # decreases its health points by 10 so it's at 90 now
print(final_boss.health)  # prints 90
```
