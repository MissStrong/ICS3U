### write()

We can also use the `write()` method to write plaintext files, which is a more common approach than using `print()`. We can use it on an opened file. 

```python
with open("document.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("Hello World!")  # prints "Hello World" to document.txt
```

This would give us the following for `document.txt`:

```
Hello World!
```

One difference between using `print()` and `write()` to write text to a plaintext file is that `print()` puts a newline character at the end of the text by default, whereas `write()` does not.

When we are writing multiple lines to the file, we can put `\n` after each line to indicate that a new line begins.

```python
with open("document.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("Hello\n")
  f.write("World!")  # prints "Hello World" to document.txt
```

This would give us the following for `document.txt`:

```
Hello
World!
```

If we didn't have the `\n` at the end of `"Hello\n"`, we would get this instead:

```
HelloWorld!
```

**Important: When you write to a file that was opened in write mode, its original contents get deleted!** 

If you want to simply add something to the bottom of an existing file, open it using `"a"` instead of `"w"`. This will open the file in **append mode**.

### Opening Plaintext Files without `with` and `as`

Files can also be opened without the keyword `with` and `as`. However, if we don't use them, we have to remember to close the file after we are done using it. If we don't close the file, unexpected things can happen, such as only some portions of the text getting printed to the file.

```python
f = open("document.txt", "w")
f.write("Hello World!")
f.close()  # this is an important step
```

The simplest way to remember to close the file is to use the `with`-`as` structure, since it will close the file automatically at the end of the block.
