### Custom Classes

Creating a custom class is like creating a custom data type. We can create our own custom classes using the keyword `class`. The convention is to write custom class names using *UpperCamelCase*. Here is an example of custom class for an enemy for an adventure game. 

```python
class Enemy:
    """An enemy in an adventure game."""
    pass  # we'll deal with this part soon

enemy = Enemy() # an enemy object
```

We can add fields to the `Enemy` class by **overriding** the constructor. Overriding a function means re-defining a function already exists. The construtor in the class is `__init__()`. When we put `self`, it allows us to use dot notation to access it.

```python
class Enemy:
    """An enemy in an adventure game."""
    def __init__(self, name, health):
        """The constructor takes a name and a number of health points."""
        self.name = name
        self.health = health

enemy = Enemy("Ganon", 10000)

print(enemy.name)  # prints Ganon
print(enemy.health)  # prints 10000
```
