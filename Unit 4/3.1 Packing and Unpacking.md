### Packing

**Packing** involves taking several values and placing them into a list, tuple, or other sequential data type. To create a packed variable, we put an asterisk (`*`) in front, which we pronounce as **splat**.

```python
*lst, = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to lst = [1, 2, 3]
*start, end = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to start = [1, 2]; end = 3
start, *end = 1, 2, 3  # equivalent to start = 1; end = [2, 3]
start, *mid, end = 1, 2, 3, 4  # equivalent to start = 1; mid = [2, 3]; end = 4
```

### Unpacking

**Unpacking** is the inverse of packing. It involves taking a sequential data type and extracting its individual items.

One of the useful ways to use this syntax is printing the individual items of a list without a loop. To unpack a variable into its individual components, we can splat it.

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
print(*lst)  # equivlent to print(1, 2, 3), which prints 1 2 3
```

We can unpack strings, lists, tuples, ranges, and several other data types. We do that by assigning one variable for each individual item. We don't need to splat these.

```python
x, y = [3, 5]
print(x)  # prints 3
print(y)  # prints 5

a, b, c = "123"
print(a)  # prints 1
print(b)  # prints 2
print(c)  # prints 3

x, y, z = (3, 5)  # raises a ValueError
x, y = (3, 5, 7)  # raises a different ValueError
```

One of the most interesting ways to use unpacking is to swap variables. The traditional way of swapping variables is to use a third variable to temporarily hold one of the values.

```python
x, y = [3, 5]  # shortcut for x = 3; y = 5

temp = x  # stores the value of x so we don't lose it
x = y  # x is y's old value
y = temp  # y is x's old value, which is stored in temp

print(x)  # prints 5
print(y)  # prints 3
```

If we use unpacking, our solution is shorter and easier to read. We can also omit the brackets when we're unpacking.

```python
x, y = 3, 5  # doesn't actually need brackets

x, y = y, x  # swaps the values of x and y

print(x)  # prints 5
print(y)  # prints 3
```
