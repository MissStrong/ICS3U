### Custom Errors

We can create our own custom errors when none of the built-in errors are suitable. We do that by creating a class that inherits the `Exception` class.

Suppose we are prompting a user to enter a word but we want to raise an error when the user doesn't follow the instructions and enters more than one word. We can create our own error, `WhitespaceError` since the input is not supposed to contain any whitespace (e.g. spaces, tabs, newlines).

```python
class WhitespaceError(Exception): # custom error for having whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline) when there shouldn't be
  def __init__(self, message = "There should not be any whitespace."):
    super().__init__(message) #

word = input("Enter one word: ")

num_words = len(word.split()) # counts the number of words in the input

if num_words != 1:
  raise WhitespaceError
```
