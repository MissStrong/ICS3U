### Reading Local Plaintext Files

Recall that we can read a plaintext file by opening it in read mode with `open()` then reading its contents using `read()` or `readlines()`.  

```python
with open("document.txt", "r") as file: 
    file_contents = file.read()
    # Do something with file_contents
```

This will work only if `document.txt` is stored in the same location as `main.py.`

### Reading Plaintext Files from a URL

TODO

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen

text_data = urlopen(url)
print(text_data.read())
```
