### Reading Local Plaintext Files

Recall that we can read a plaintext file by opening it in read mode with `open()` then reading its contents using `read()` or `readlines()`.  

```python
try:
    with open("document.txt", "r") as f:
        # do something with the file
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Something went wrong opening the file.")
```

### Reading Plaintext Files from a URL

Sometimes we will want to open a file that is stored online. We can use the `request` module in the `urllib` library to access files stored online.

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen

url = "put the file's URL here"
text_data = urlopen(url)
print(text_data.read().decode('utf-8'))  # prints the file contents
```

The `.decode('utf-8')` is needed to convert a byte string into a regular string.

The dot in `urllib.request` indicates that we're accessing just the `request` module, not the entire `urllib` library.

Just like before, opening a file will only work if the filename is spelled correctly, the file is not corrupt, the file exists, and the file is in the specified location (at the URL). To prevent errors when reading a file, we can use try and except.

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen

try:
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MissStrong/ICS3U/refs/heads/main/Miscellaneous/Shakespeare/hamlet.txt"
    text_data = urlopen(url)
    print(text_data.read().decode('utf-8'))  # prints the file contents
except ValueError:
    print("Something went wrong opening the file.")
```
