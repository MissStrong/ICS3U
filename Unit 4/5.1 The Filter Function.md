### filter()

Whenever we need to remove items from a list that have something in common, we can use the `filter()` function.

First, we create a custom function that returns `True` or `False`.

```python
def is_an_odd_square(num):
    """Determines whether a number is an odd square number."""
    return 0 <= num and num ** 0.5 % 2 == 1
```

Then, we can filter items from a list that are NOT odd squares.

```python
def is_an_odd_square(num):
    """Determines whether a number is an odd square number."""
    return 0 <= num and num ** 0.5 % 2 == 1

numbers = [1, 3, 7, 9, 16, 24, 25, 28, 49, 101]

numbers = list(filter(is_an_odd_square, numbers))

print(numbers)  # prints [1, 9, 25, 49]
```

The reason we need to call `list()` is because `filter()` returns a data type called `filter`, but we want it to be a list instead.

We could also just use a built-in function instead of making a custom function.

```python
strings = ["a", "123", "cul8r", "xyz"]

strings = list(filter(str.isalpha, strings))

print(strings)  # prints ["a", "xyz"]
```

The reason we use `str.isalpha` instead of just `isalpha` is because the `isalpha()` function is a [string method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods), and methods require the library name in front of the dot to differentiate them from other functions. We don't need `import str` since `str` is one of the libraries that is imported by default.

### Lambda Functions

We can use lambda functions with `filter()`.

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 7, 9, 16, 24, 25, 28, 49, 101]

numbers = list(filter(lambda n: 0 <= n and n ** 0.5 % 2 == 1, numbers))

print(numbers)  # prints [1, 9, 25, 49]
```
