### map()

Whenever we need to modify all the items in a list at once, we can use the `map()` function.

First, we create a custom function that gets applied to each item.

```python
def triple_string(s):
    """Triples a string."""
    return s * 3
```

Then, we can perform the function on all of the items in a list.

```python
def triple_string(s):
    """Triples a string."""
    return s * 3

strings = ["a", "bc", "de", "fgh"]

strings = list(map(triple_string, strings))

print(strings)  # prints ["aaa", "bcbcbc", "dedede", "fghfghfgh"]
```

Again, we need to use `list()` to convert the data type to a list.

Also again, we could also just use a built-in function instead of making a custom function.

```python
strings = ["a", "123", "cul8r", "xyz"]

strings = list(map(str.upper, strings))

print(strings)  # prints ["A", "123", "CUL8R", "XYZ"]
```

### Lambda Functions

We can use lambda functions with `map()`.

```python
strings = ["a", "bc", "de", "fgh"]

strings = list(map(lambda s: s * 3, strings))

print(strings)  # prints ["aaa", "bcbcbc", "dedede", "fghfghfgh"]
```
