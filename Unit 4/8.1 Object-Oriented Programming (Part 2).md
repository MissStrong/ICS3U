### Inheritance

Inheritance is the last way in which class can be associated with other classes. Inheritance can be referred to as a "is-a" association. Unlike aggregation and composition, the subclass inherits all the fields and methods from the superclass.

To indicate that a subclass inherits a superclass, the name of the superclass is written in parentheses in the signature (the line that has `def`) of the subclass.

For example, if we are creating a two-player game with a human player and a computer player (i.e. a bot), we can create a `Player` class that has the field `name` (since all players have names), and two subclasses `Bot` and `Human`.

```python
class Player:
    """A superclass for any type of player."""
  
    def __init__(self, name):
        """A player has a name."""
        self.name = name
    
class Bot(Player):  # Bot inherits all the fields and methods from Player
    """A bot is a type of player."""
  
    def __init__(self, name, level):
        """A bot has a name."""
        super().__init__(name) 
        # the level field is for the bot's difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard.
        self.level = level

class Human(Player): # Human inherits all the fields and methods from Player
    """A human is a type of player."""
  
    def __init__(self, name):
        """A human has a name."""
        super().__init__(name)
```

The `super()` function creates an object belonging to superclass and allows us to use its fields and methods. `super().__init__()` calls the constructor from the superclass. Since it's a function call, `self` is not passed as an argument.
