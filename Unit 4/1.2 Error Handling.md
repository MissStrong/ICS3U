### Error Handling

Whenever you run a program that has errors, you may have noticed that the console attempts to tells you what kind of error it is. 

For example, if you try to divide by zero, you get a message in the console saying that there was an error called `ZeroDivisionError`.

An **error** or **exception** is a problem that occurs while a program is running. When an error occurs in Python, we say that program **raises** an error. When this happens and your program doesn't **handle** it, the program terminates abruptly. We can handle errors using a `try`-`except` structure.

Here is an example of a function that handles a division by zero error.

```python
n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

try:
  print(1/n)
except:
  print("You divided by zero! :(")
```

The content in the `try` block is run first. The program tries to run the lines in the block; if an error is raised and the rest of the block does not run. 

The content in the `except` block runs only when an errror such as `ZeroDivisionError` has been raised. It "catches" the error and prevents the program from abruptly terminating and giving you a red error message.

If we want an `except` block to catch only a specific type of error, we can do that like this:

```python
try:
  n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
  print(1/n)
except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("You divided by zero! :(")
except:
  print("That's not even an integer! >:(")
```

When we are opening a file to read it and we want to make sure the program  doesn't crash when the filepath does not exist, we can call `open()` in a `try` block and catch the `FileNotFoundError` in an `except` block. 

```python
try:
  with open(filepath, "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
  print("That file does not exist.")
```

If want to know what error we got, we can catch an `Exception`, which is the generic name of all errors and store it in a variable using the keyword `as`.

```python
try:
  # try something here
  pass
except Exception as e:  # stores the error in the variable e
  print("Error message:", e )
```
