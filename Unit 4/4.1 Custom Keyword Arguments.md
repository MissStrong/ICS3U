### Custom Keyword Arguments

Recall that `print()` takes the keyword arguments `sep` and `end`.

```python
print("Hello", " World", sep = "_", end = "!\n")  # prints "Hello_World!"
```

We can create custom functions that take keyword arguments by placing a *double asterisk* `**` before a parameter. 

```python
def print_keywords(**kwargs):  # kwargs is short for "keyword arguments"
    """Takes keyword arguments and prints them."""
    print(kwargs)
  
print_keywords(kw1 = 1, kw2 = 2, kw3 = 3)  # prints {'kw1': 1, 'kw2': 2, 'kw3': 3}
```

The keyword arguments are stored in a dictionary. The keys are the keywords and the values are the values associated with each keyword. The `**` does **dictionary unpacking**.

Notice that when we call the function, the keywords are variables, not strings. However, in the function the keyword arguments become strings.

Functions that take keyword arguments typically only take specific keywords. In a custom function, we can raise an error when the keywords are different from what we expect.

```python
def print_linear_relation(**constants): 
    """Takes some keyword arguments representing the constants of 
    a linear relation in the form y = mx + b and prints the relation.
    """
    try:
        m = constants["m"]
        b = constants["b"]
        if len(constants) > 2:
            raise Exception("Invalid keyword arguments.")  # there were keywords other than "m" and "b" 
        print(f"y  = {m}x + {b}")
    except KeyError:
        error = True
    if error:
        raise Exception("One or more keyword arguments are missing.") # "m" and/or "b" are missing
  
print_linear_relation(m = 2, b = 4)  # prints y = 2x + 4
print_linear_relation(b = 4, m = 2)  # also prints y = 2x + 4
print_linear_relation(m = 8)  # raises an error 
print_linear_relation(b = 3)  # raises an error 
print_linear_relation()  # raises an error 
print_linear_relation(m = 9, b = 7, c = 1)  # raises an error 
```

If we want some of the keyword arguments to have default values, we can add them to the dictionary.

```python
def print_linear_relation(**constants):
    """Takes some keyword arguments representing the constants of 
    a linear relation in the form y = mx + b and prints the relation.
    """
    if "m" not in constants:
        constants["m"] = 1  # m is 1 if it was not in constants
    if "b" not in constants:
        constants["b"] = 0  # b is 0 if it was not in constants
    m = constants["m"]
    b = constants["b"]
    if len(constants) != 2:
        raise Exception("Invalid keyword arguments.")  # there were keywords other than "m" and "b" 
    print(f"y = {m}x + {b}")
    
print_linear_relation(m = 2, b = 4)  # prints y = 2x + 4
print_linear_relation(b = 4, m = 2)  # also prints y = 2x + 4
print_linear_relation(m = 8)  # prints y = 8x + 0
print_linear_relation(b = 3) # prints y = 1x + 3
print_linear_relation() # prints y = 1x + 0
print_linear_relation(m = 9, b = 7, c = 1)  # raises an error 
```
