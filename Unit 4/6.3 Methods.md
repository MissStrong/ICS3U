### Overriding Methods

If we call `dir()` on a blank custom class, we get the following: 

```python
['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__']
```

We can **override** any of these methods by redefining them within our class.

Here are a few in particular that are useful:

* `__init__()` is the constructor and by default it doesn't take any arguements
* `__repr__()` is for printing (`print()`) and by default it prints the object's location in memory
* `__eq__()` is for equality (`==`) and by default it compares whether two objects share the same location in memory

```python
class Enemy:
    """An enemy in an adventure game."""

    def __init__(self, name, health):
        """The constructor takes a name, a list of attacks, and a number of health points."""
        self.name = name
        self.health = health

    def __repr__(self):  # Overriding the print function
        """Printing the objects displays the name, list of attacks, and health points."""
        return f"Name: {self.name}, Health: {self.health}"
  
    def __eq__(self, other_enemy):  # Overriding the == operator
        """Two enemies are considered equal if all their fields have the same values as each other."""
        return other_enemy.__dict__ == self.__dict__ # __dict__ is a dictionary of all the fields
```

The `self` keyword is passed in all methods. Field names begins with `self.` when they are being used in a method in order to distinguish between them from the parameters of the method. Whenever we call any method from the class, we omit the `self` parameter.

```python
ganon1 = Enemy("Ganon", 100)

print(ganon1)
''' prints the following:
Name: Ganon
Health: 100
'''

ganon2 = Enemy("Ganon", ["sword", "ice blocks", "tornado", "earthquake"], 100)
print(ganon1 == ganon2)  # prints True (since they have identical fields)
```

If we didn't overide the print function or the `==` operation , here's what it could look like instead:

```python

ganon1 = Enemy("Ganon", 100)
print(ganon1) # prints <__main__.Enemy object at 0x7f9d2405b5b0> (this address should be different each time the program is run)

ganon2 = Enemy("Ganon", 100)
print(ganon1 == ganon2)  # prints False (since they have different addresses)
```

### Custom Methods

The syntax for a method is the same as the syntax for any function, except the first parameter is `self`.

```python
class Enemy:
    """An enemy in an adventure game."""

    def __init__(self, name, attacks, health):
        """The constructor takes a name, a list of attacks, and a number of health points."""
        self.name = name
        self.attacks = attacks
        self.health = health

    def take_damage(self, damage_points):  # custom method for reducing the health points
        """Reduces the enemy's health by damage_points points and ensures it doesn't go below zero."""
        assert 0 <= damage_points  # prevents negative damage_points
        self.health -= damage_points
        if self.health < 0:  # health can't be negative
            self.health = 0
```

We call custom methods using dot notation, just like any other method. The `self` is a special parameter that we ignore when we call the method.

```python
final_boss = Enemy("Ganon", 10000) # Creates an enemy object
final_boss.take_damage(100) # decreases its health points by 10 so it's at 9900 now
print(final_boss.health)  # prints 9900
```
