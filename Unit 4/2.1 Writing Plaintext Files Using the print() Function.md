### Standard Output

**Standard output**, i.e. `sys.stdout` in Python, is the default location that text gets printed to. In CodeHS, standard output is the console.

However, we can change where text gets printed to in several ways.

### print()

We can change where `print()` prints text by including an argument for the `file` parameter.

Before we call `print()`, we need to open the file using the `open()` function. The first parameter in the `open()` function is the filepath and the second parameter is the **mode** we want the file to open in. Since we are writing to a file, we will open it **write mode**. If a file with that filename already exists, it will open it; otherwise, it will create a new file with that filename.

```python
with open("document.txt", "w") as f:
  print("Hello World!", file = f)  # prints "Hello World!" to document.txt
```

This would give us the following for `document.txt`:

```
Hello World!
```

The `w` stands for "write mode" and `f` can be replaced with any variable name.

Another way to open a file is this instead:

```python
f = open("document.txt", "w")
print("Hello World!", file = f)
f.close()
```

If we don't use `with` and `as`, then we need to remember to close the file with `.close()`, otherwise we'll get a blank file or a partially-written file. This is a very common mistake when writing programs that write files!
