### RGB Values

All colours that can be displayed on a computer can be expressed using 24 bits. One of the most common ways to express them is using a red-green-blue (**RGB**) value. An RGB value shows how to create the colour using combinations of red, green, and blue. It is often represented as a tuple in which each number is an 8-bit integer ranging from 0 to 255.

Here are the RGB values of common colours.

| Colour | RGB value       |
| ------ | --------------- |
| Black  | (0, 0, 0)       |
| White  | (255, 255, 255) |
| Red    | (255, 0, 0)     |
| Orange | (128, 127, 0)   |
| Yellow | (255, 255, 0)   |
| Green  | (0, 255, 0)     |
| Blue   | (0, 0, 255)     |
| Purple | (128, 0, 128)   |
| Pink   | (255, 192, 203) |

### Hexadecimal Values

Another common way to express a colour is using its **hexadecimal value**, or **hex value** for short. A colour's hex value can be determined by converting it's RGB value. Each of the three individual values can be translated into a 2-digit hex value and we can merge them to get a 6-digit hex value. 

For example, pink's individual RGB values are 255 (#FF), 192 (#C0), 203(#CB), so pink's hex value is #FFC0CB. The has symbol `#` is often used to indicate that a string is a hex value.

### Colours in Tkinter

Most functions in Tkinter that take a colour as a parameter can take the colour's hex value. For convenience, we can make constants for the colours we use in our program.

```python
# Initializing colours (using RGB values) so we can use them later
WHITE = "#FFFFFF"
BLACK = ""#000000""
RED = "#FF0000"
GREEN = "#00FF00"
BLUE = "#0000FF"
```

The default colour of a window in Tkinter is grey. We can change the colour of the screen using the `.configure()` method on the window and passing the background colour as a keyword argument for `background` like this:

```python
# Initial setup
from tkinter import *
window = Tk()

# Creates a constant for standard blue and sets the background of the window to be this colour
BLUE = "#0000FF"
window.configure(background = BLUE)

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

Tkinter also recognizes [all these colour names](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TkCmd/colors.html). To use any of them, we just write the name as a string.

```python
# Initial setup
from tkinter import *
window = Tk()

# Sets the background of the window to be colour called "blue violet" (from the list of recognized colour names)
window.configure(background = "blue violet")

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```
