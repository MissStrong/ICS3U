### Sets

A **set** is a non-ordered collection of unique items. A set uses curly braces `{}` as delimiters. The individual items are separated by commas.

```python
numbers = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}
```

Two sets are equivalent if they contain the same items. The order of the items doesn't matter.

```python
numbers1 = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}

numbers2 = {12, 1, 4, 19, 7}

print(numbers1 == numbers2)  # prints True
```

A set cannot contain duplicate items. If we add an item to a set that is already there, it doesn't change anything.

```python
numbers1 = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}

numbers2 = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19, 4, 7}

print(numbers1 == numbers2)  # prints True
```

A set does not have indices. For example, we cannot get the "first item" in a set, since there is no order to the items.

```python
numbers = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}

print(numbers[0])  # raises an error
```

Since the items in a set aren't in any particular order, the items might not get printed in the same order as were added in. The order in which the items are outputted depends on where they are stored in memory, which could be different every time the program is run.


```python
numbers = {0, 5, 10, 15, 20}

print(numbers)  # prints {0, 5, 10, 15, 20}, but the order of the items might be different
```

### set()

If we want to initialize an empty set, we need to use `set()`. If we try to initialize an empty set using `{}`, it won't work as intended because the program will treat it like a **dictionary**, which also uses curly braces as delimiters. We'll learn about dictionaries later.

```python
numbers = set()  # creates an empty set
```

We can also cast a list or a string to a set using `set()`.

```python
print(set([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]))  # prints {1, 2, 3, 4} (the order might be different)
print(set("Hello"))  # prints {'H', 'e', 'l', 'o'} (the order might be different)
```

### Looping Through Sets

Sets can be iterated through using a `for` loop.

```python
numbers = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}
total = 0

for n in numbers:
  total += n  # adds together all the numbers in the set

print(total)  # prints 43
```

### Set Methods

To add items to a set, we can use `.add()`. To remove items from a set, we can use `.remove()`. 

```python
numbers = {1, 4, 7, 12, 19}

numbers.add(5)  # adds 5 to the set
numbers.add(7)  # doesn't do anything since 7 is already in the set
numbers.remove(12)  # removes 12 from the set

print(numbers)  # prints {1, 4, 5, 7, 19} (the order could be different)
```

There are several other methods we can use. Here is the [full list of set methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set).
