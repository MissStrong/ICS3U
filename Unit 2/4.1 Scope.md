### Scope

Scope refers to the places where a variable can be accessed. Not all variables can be accessed from anywhere inside of our program.

### Local Scope

**Local variables** (variables that have **local scope**) cannot be accessed from anywhere within the program. They are initialized inside a structure, such as a function or loop, and can only be accessed from within that structure. 

```python
def foo():
  lst = [1, 2, 3]
  return lst
  
print(lst)  # this does not work; the program claims that lst is not defined
```

Since `lst` is defined within the function `foo()`, it can only be accessed within that function. We can say that the **scope** of `lst` is the function `foo()`. 

N.B.: `foo()` is a commonly used name for a function that doesn't accomplish anything meaningful.


### Global Scope

**Global variables** (variables that have **global scope**) can be accessed from anywhere within a program. They are initialized outside of a structure such as outside a function or a loop.

Although they can be accessed from anywhere, they cannot be modified from within a function. Instead, you'll end up making a new local variable that shares the same name as the global variable.

```python
days_left = 81

def update_days_left(new_value):
  """Update the value of days_left to new_value."""
  days_left = new_value  # this doesn't work, but it doesn't raise an error
  
update_days_left(80)
print(days_left)  # prints 81 instead of 80
```

The solution is to use the keyword `global`. This allows the variable to be modified from anywhere within the program.

```python
days_left = 81

def update_days_left(new_value):
  """Update the value of days_left to new_value."""
  global days_left  # makes days_left below not local
  days_left = new_value
  
update_days_left(80)
print(days_left)  # prints 80
```
