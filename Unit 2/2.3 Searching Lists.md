### Searching Lists

If we're just checking whether a list has a particular item, we can use the keyword `in`.

```python
print("potato" in ["bread", "milk", "potato"])  # prints True
print("cereal" in ["bread", "milk", "potato"])  # prints False
```

If we want to go through a list by looking at each item one by one, we can use a *for* loop.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato"]
  
for item in groceries:
  print(item)  # prints each item in the list
```

If we wanted to print the indices (plural of index) too, we could use the `range()` function. We can use the `len()` function to get the **len**gth of a list.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato"]
  
for index in range(len(groceries)):
  print(index, groceries[index])  # prints each index in the list and its corresponding item
```

However, there is a useful function `enumerate()` that lets us use the index and the item at the same time.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato"]
  
for index, item in enumerate(groceries):
  print(index, item)  # prints each index in the list and its corresponding item
```
