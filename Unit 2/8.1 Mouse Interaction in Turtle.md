### Mouse Interaction in Turtle

Turtle has two functions that can be used to detect mouse pressing: `onclick()` and `onrelease()`. 

The `onclick()` function calls a function of our choice whenever we click on the turtle. The catch is that the function must take two parameters indicating the current (x, y) coordinate of the turtle, but we don't need to use `x` or `y` and we can also just get the position of any turtle using `position()` anyway. The name of the function we want is passed as an argument in `onclick()`.

```python
# Importing the turtle module
from turtle import *
from turtle import _CFG  # we need this to remove the scrollers

# Resizes the default canvas size to prevent scrollers
_CFG["canvwidth"] = 1 
_CFG["canvheight"] = 1

# Creates a window with the size 400 by 300 and sets the title
setup(400, 300)
title("My Turtle Animation")

# Nancy is back
nancy = Turtle()
nancy.shape("turtle")
nancy.speed(6)
nancy.color("firebrick")

# This function gets called when we click on Nancy
def spin(x, y):
  """Nancy goes forward then spins in a circle."""
  nancy.forward(100)
  nancy.circle(30)
  nancy.left(90)

nancy.onclick(spin)

# Hides the turtle after she is done drawing
hideturtle()

# Keeps the program running after the drawing is complete
done()
```

The `onrelease()` function is just like `onclick()` except it calls the function when we let go of a mouse button.

```python
# Importing the turtle module
from turtle import *
from turtle import _CFG  # we need this to remove the scrollers

# Resizes the default canvas size to prevent scrollers
_CFG["canvwidth"] = 1 
_CFG["canvheight"] = 1

# Creates a window with the size 400 by 300 and sets the title
setup(400, 300)
title("My Turtle Animation")

# Nancy is back
nancy = Turtle()
nancy.shape("turtle")
nancy.speed(6)
nancy.color("firebrick")

# This function gets called when we click and let go of Nancy
def spin(x, y):
  """Nancy goes forward then spins in a circle."""
  nancy.forward(100)
  nancy.circle(30)
  nancy.left(90)

nancy.onrelease(spin)

# Keeps the program running after the drawing is complete
done()
```

For both `onclick()` and `onrelease()`, we could pass a second argument indicating the mouse button. `1` is left click, `2` is middle click, and `3` is right click.


### Modifications for CodeHS

Here is the same program as above, but modified to work for CodeHS.

```python
hideturtle() # hides the default turtle

# Nancy is back
nancy = turtle.Turtle()
nancy.shape("turtle")
nancy.speed(6)
nancy.color("firebrick")

# This function gets called when we click and let go of Nancy
def spin(x, y):
  """Nancy goes forward then spins in a circle."""
  nancy.forward(100)
  nancy.circle(30)
  nancy.left(90)

nancy.onrelease(spin)
```
