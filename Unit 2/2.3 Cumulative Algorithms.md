### Cumulative Algorithms

A **cumulative algorithm** is an algorithm that involves updating a value as we progress through a list. For example, if we are asked to find the sum of some numbers that are slowly being read out loud to us one by one, we could keep track of the running total as each new number is being said.

We can apply this idea to in a variety of situations, such as:
* Finding the sum or product of numbers
* Findng the lowest or highest number
* Finding the shortest or longest string
* Finding the most or least frequent value

For example, if we need to find the lowest number in a list, we could do the following:

```python
lst = [5, -1, 0, 12, -5, 18, 3]

def lowest_number(num_list):
    """Returns the lowest number in a list of numbers."""
    if len(num_list) == 0:
        return # the list is empty
    lowest_so_far = num_list[0]  # we start by setting the first item to be the lowest
    for item in num_list:  # checks each item in the list for lower numbers
        if item < lowest_so_far:
            lowest_so_far = item  # we have found a lower number so we update lowest_so_far
    return lowest_so_far  # after we go through the entire list, lowest_so_far will be the lowest number

print(f"The lowest number in {lst} is {lowest_number(lst)}.") # prints -5
```
