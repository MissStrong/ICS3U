### Functions in Math versus Functions in Computer Science

**If you haven't taken the Grade 11 math course *Functions* (MCR3U) or *Functions and Applications* (MCF3M), you can skip this note.**

In math, a relation is a relationship involving one or more variables. A function is a relation in which each independent variable value has only one corresponding dependent variable value.

For example, *f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + 4* is a function, in which:

* *f* is the name of the function
* *f(x)* is the dependent variable
* *x* is the independent variable
* *x<sup>2</sup> + 4* is how to compute the value of the dependent variable given the value of the independent variable.

Functions can have more than one independent variable. For example, *f(x, y, z) = 4x + 2y - 1/z* is also a function.

Functions in computer science may look different to functions in math, but they are fundamentally similar.

| | Math Example | Python Example |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Function | f(x, y, z) = 4x + 2y - 1/z | `def foo(x, y, z): `<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`return 4*x + 2*y - 1/z` |
| Function name | *f* | `foo` |
| Parameters (Independent Variables) | *x*, *y*, *z* | `x`, `y`, `z` |
| Return Value (Value of Dependent Variable) | *4x + 2y - 1/z* | `4*x + 2*y - 1/z` |
| Example| *f(7, -3, 1) = 4(7) + 2(-3) - 1/1 = 28 - 6 - 1 = 21* | `a = foo(7, -3, 1)`<br/></br>`# the value of a is initialized to 21` |

In math, *f*, *g*, and *h* are generic names for functions. In computer science, `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` are generic names for functions. You can also come up with your own dummy names for functions that aren't supposed to be meaningful. I'm quite fond of `bloop`.
