### join()

`join()` is a string method. We can use it to turn lists, tuples, and sets into a string. The string in front of `.join()` is the separator between each item.

```python
print("".join(["A", "B", "C"])) # prints "ABC"
print(" ".join(["A", "B", "C"])) # prints "A B C"
print("-".join(["A", "B", "C"])) # prints "A-B-C"
```
We can also use `join()` to put a separator between the characters in a string.

```python
print("+".join("123")) # prints "1+2+3"
```

`join()` only works when the parameter is a string or a collection of strings. For example, it does not work with a list of integers.

```python
print("".join([1, 2, 3])) # raises a TypeError
```

### Generator Expressions

If the items in a collection are a different data type, we can use a **generator expression** to turn them into strings.

```python
print("".join(str(n) for n in [1, 2, 3])) # prints "123"
```

Generator expressions have the following form: `expression for item in collection`. In the previous example, the expression is `str(n)`, the variable for each item is `n`, and the collection is the list `[1, 2, 3]`.

You can think of it as replacing each item in the collection with the expression. In the previous example, each number is converted into a string.

Here is another example of using a generator expressions to modify the items in a list.

```python
print(", ".join(item.upper() for item in ["Apple", "Banana", "Carrot"])) # prints "APPLE, BANANA, CARROT"
```

This example converts every string to all upper case before they are joined together with commas.
