### Date Formatting

Python has a module called `datetime` that lets us create dates and get information about them.

```python
from datetime import datetime

date = datetime(2015, 3, 14) # March 14, 2015
```

One of the properties of a date is its weekday, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. We can find out what day of the week the date is on using the `weekday()` method.

```python
print(date.weekday()) # prints 6 since it was a Saturday
```

We can also use the `strftime()` (string format time) method to access properties of the date. There are placeholders beginning with `%` for each property. For example, `%A` is the day of the week, `%B` is the month name, `%d` is the day number, and `%Y` is the year.

```python
print(date.strftime("%A, %B %d, %Y ")) # prints Saturday, March 14, 2015
```
