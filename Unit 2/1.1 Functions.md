### Built-in Functions

A function takes an input and performs a sequence of steps to give an output. They have a name and are followed by a pair of parentheses. When a function is **called**, the inputs are placed inside the parentheses.

In addition to the string methods we used in *Input Checker*, we've also seen these built-in functions:

* `print()`
* `input()`
* `range()`

We can find the full list of built-in functions here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html.

We've also seen the following functions used to convert data types:

* `str()`
* `int()`
* `float()`

These are called **constructors**.  They create new **objects**. (We'll get to what that means in a later lesson.) 

### Custom Functions

You can create your own functions when there aren't any built-in functions that suit your needs.

Here is an example of a custom function:

````python
def is_even(num):
    """Determines whether an integer is an even number"""
    return num % 2 == 0:
````

The keyword `def` indicates that we are **defining** a function. The function name here is `is_even` and it takes one **parameter** (i.e. inputs), `num`.

The **header** of a function is the line that defines the function. The function header for the example above is `def is_even(num):`.

The keyword `return` indicates the **return value**. In this example, the return value is `True` if the number is even and `False` if the number is odd. The tab space before the `return` statement is necessary since it is a part of the body of the function. 

We can call this function within the same program to check if an integer is even or odd.

````python
print(is_even(12)) # prints True
````

**Parameters** are the variable names used in a function. The function `is_even()` has one parameter, `num`.

**Arguments** are the values of the parameters you use when you are calling a function. The function call `is_evev(12)` has one argument, 12.

### Return Statements

When we call a function that has multiple `return` statements, it will stop running as soon as it hits the first one. 

```python
def square_or_rectangle(length, width):
    """Determines whether a number is an even number"""
    if length < 0 or width < 0:
        return "neither"
    if length == width:
        return "square"
    return "rectangle"
    print("done") # this line is never reached

print(square_or_rectangle(15, 17)) # prints "rectangle"
```

If the program does not hit any `return` statement or a blank `return` statement, the return value is a built-in constant called `None`.

```python
def do_nothing():
    """Does nothing."""
    # since there is no return, the return value is None

print(do_nothing()) # prints None
```
