Suppose we want to make a function that calculates the average of the numbers in a list. We could use a cumulative algorithm to add up all the numbers one by one, then we can divide by the number of numbers we have.

```python
num_list = [4, 1, 8, -2, 5]

def average(num_list):
    """Returns the average of all the numbers in num_list."""
    total = 0 # the variable we're going to update

    for num in num_list: # adds up all the numbers on by one
        total += num

    size = len(num_list)

    return total/size

print(average(num_list)) # prints 3.2
```

### Helper Functions

A **helper function** is a function that helps another function by doing part of the work. In our `average()` function, we are adding up all the numbers before we divide them. We can make a sepate function to do that for us.

```python
num_list = [4, 1, 8, -2, 5]

def add(num_list): # this is the helper function
    """Returns the sum of all the numbers in num_list."""
    total = 0

    for num in num_list: # adds up all the numbers on by one
        total += num

def average(num_list):
    """Returns the average of all the numbers in num_list."""
    total = add(num_list)
    size = len(num_list)

    return total/size

print(average(num_list)) # prints 3.2
```

Helper functions help made code more readable. They are also useful when you use the same algorithm in multiple parts of your program.
