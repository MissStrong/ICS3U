### round()

We can use `round()` to round integers and floats.

```python
print(round(12.7)) # prints 13
print(round(-1.1)) # prints -1
print(round(53)) # prints 53
```

We can specify the number of decimal places as the second argument.

```python
print(round(3.1415926535, 0)) # prints 3
print(round(3.1415926535, 1)) # prints 3.1
print(round(3.1415926535, 2)) # prints 3.14
print(round(3.1415926535, 3)) # prints 3.141
print(round(3.1415926535, 4)) # prints 3.1416
```

We can round to powers of ten (the nearest 10, 100, 1000 etc) by using a negative integer as the second argument.

```python
print(round(1337, 0)) # prints 1337
print(round(1337, -1)) # prints 1340
print(round(1337, -2)) # prints 1300
print(round(1337, -3)) # prints 1000
```

### Banker's Rounding

When we have a number that ends in .5, we might expect it to round up for positive numbers and round down for negative numbers, but `round()` picks the even number! This is called [banker's rounding](https://rounding.to/understanding-the-bankers-rounding/), since banks use this kind of rounding to remove bias.

```python
print(round(-1.5)) # prints -2
print(round(0.5)) # prints 0
print(round(1.5)) # prints 2
print(round(2.5)) # prints 2
print(round(5.5)) # prints 6
print(round(6.5)) # prints 6
```
