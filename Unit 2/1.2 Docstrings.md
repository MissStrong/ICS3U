### Docstrings

A **docstring** (short for _**doc**umentation **string**_) is a multi-line string that serves as the description for a function.

```python
def is_even_number(num):
  """Determines whether a number is an even number."""
  return num % 2 == 0
```
We can elaborate on them as much as we want.

```python
def is_even_number(num):
  """Determines whether a number is an even number.
  
  This function takes one argument, num, which can any numeric data type.

  This function returns True if num is an even number, and False otherwise.
  """
  return num % 2 == 0
```

The conventions for docstrings are outlined in [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). To summarize the key points:
* A docstring explains what a function does.
* A docstring uses `"""` as delimiters.
* For multi-line doc strings, the first `"""` is on the same line as the first line of text and the last `"""` is on a line all on its own. 
* We can access the documentation of any function, including built-in functions,  using `__doc__`. The double underscores can be pronounced as "dunder" (**d**ouble **under**score).

```
> print.__doc__
"print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)\n\nPrints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.\nOptional keyword arguments:\nfile:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.\nsep:   string inserted between values, default a space.\nend:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.\nflush: whether to forcibly flush the stream."
> input.__doc__
'Read a string from standard input.  The trailing newline is stripped.\n\nThe prompt string, if given, is printed to standard output without a\ntrailing newline before reading input.\n\nIf the user hits EOF (*nix: Ctrl-D, Windows: Ctrl-Z+Return), raise EOFError.\nOn *nix systems, readline is used if available.'
```
