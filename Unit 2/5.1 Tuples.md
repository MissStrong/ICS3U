### Tuples

A **tuple** (pronounced "too-pull") is a data structure that stores an ordered set of items, like a list. The key difference between lists and tuples is that that tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are initiated. Tuples also use parentheses instead of square brackets.

```python
coordinate = (4, -5)
```

To create a tuple with one item in it, we put a comma after the item to indicate that it's a tuple and not just a value enclosed in brackets. 

```python
t = (8,)  # creates a tuple with just 8 in it
```

To create an empty tuple, we can use `()` or `tuple()`.

```python
t1 = ()  # creates an empty tuple
t2 = tuple()  # also creates and empty tuple
```

We can use square brackets to get an item of a tuple at a particular index.

```python
coordinate = (4, -5)

print(coordinate[0])  # prints 4
print(coordinate[1])  # prints -5
```

We can use `len()` to determine the number of items in a tuple.

```python
coordinate = (4, -5)
print(len(coordinate))  # prints 2
```

We can use `in` to determine whether an item is in a tuple.

```python
coordinate = (4, -5)

print(4 in coordinate)  # prints True
print(-4 in coordinate)  # prints False
```

Since tuples are immutable, we can't change the items in it or add new items to it.

```python
coordinate = (4, -5)

coordinate[1] = -7  # this raises an error
coordinate += (-3,)  # this also raises an error
```

However, we can create new tuples based on existing tuples.

```python
coordinate_1 = (4, -5)

coordinate_2 = (coordinate_1[0], -7)

coordinate_3 = (coordinate_1[0],) + (12,)

print(coordinate_1)  # prints (4, -5)
print(coordinate_2)  # prints (4, -7)
print(coordinate_3)  # prints (4, 12)
```
