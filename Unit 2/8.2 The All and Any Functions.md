### all()

`all()` is function that takes a collection and returns `True` when every item is `True`, and `False` otherwise.

```python
print(all([True, True, True, True])) # prints True
print(all([True, True, False, True])) # prints False
```

`all()` is typically used with a generator expression.

```python
print(all(word.isupper() for word in ["A", "B", "C", "D"])) # prints True
print(all(word.isupper() for wprd in ["A", "b", "C", "D"])) # prints False
```

Since `isupper()` returns `True` when a string is written in all upper case letters, the generator expression replaces every upper case word is replaced with `True`.

### any()

`any()` works exactly like `all()`, except it returns `True` when at least one item is `True`.

```python
print(any([True, True, True, True])) # prints True
print(any([True, True, False, True])) # prints True
print(any([False, False, False, False])) # prints False
```

Here are some examples with generator expressions.

```python
print(any(len(food)>5 for food in ["Apple", "Banana", "Carrot"])) # prints True
print(any(len(food)>6 for food in ["Apple", "Banana", "Carrot"])) # prints False
```

The first one is checking whether there is any word in the list that is 5 characters long. The second one is checking for 6.
