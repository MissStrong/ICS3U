### type()

When we need to determine what data type a value is, we can use the `type()` function.

```
> type("6") == str
True
> type(6) == int
True
> type(6) == float
False
> type("True") == bool
False
```

Every data type belongs to a **class**, so when we display a data type, it will look like this. 

```
> type("6")
<class 'str'>
> type(6)
<class 'int'>
> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
> type([])
<class 'list'>
```

We'll get to what classes are later in this course.

Sometimes a data type might not be what we expect it to be. For example, when we create a list using `range()`, the data type is actually `range`, not `list`.

```
> type(range(10)) == list
False
> type(range(10))
<class 'range'>
> type(range(10)) == range
True
```

Whenever we need a sequence data type such as `range` to be a list, we can call the list constructur `list()` to convert it to a list.

```
> type(list(range(10))) == list
True
```


### isinstance()

There is another built-in function that checks what data type a value, but it doesn't work correctly with Booleans.

```
> isinstance(False, int)
True
```

This is because the original version of Python didn't have `True` or `False` â€“ instead it had 1 and 0, which are ints. `type()` is newer than `ininstance()` so it'll work correctly with Booleans.
