### Adding or Removing Items to/from a List

We can add items to a list or remove items from a list at any point after we initialize it. We can add items using the `append()` function and we can remove them using the `remove()` function.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato"]

groceries.append("banana")

print(groceries)  # prints ['bread', 'milk', 'potato', 'banana']

groceries.remove("milk")

print(groceries)  # prints ["bread', 'potato', 'banana']
```

If we want to add an item to a particular index, we can use `insert()`.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato"]

groceries.insert(0, "cereal")  # this puts "cereal" at index 0 and pushes the other items over one spot

print(groceries)  # prints ['cereal', 'bread', 'milk', 'potato']
```

If we want to remove an item at a particular index, we can use `pop()`.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato"]

groceries.pop(0)  # this removes the item at index 0, which is "bread"

print(groceries)  # prints ['milk', 'potato']
```

### Sorting Lists

It's sometimes convenient when a list is in alphanumeric order. We can make a list sorted by using the `sort()` function.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato", "banana", "cereal"]
 
groceries.sort()

print(groceries)  # prints ['banana', 'bread", 'cereal', 'milk', 'potato']
```

There is also a function (not a method) named `sorted()` that returns a sorted list. Use `sorted()` when you don't want to alter the original list and `.sort()` otherwise.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato", "banana", "cereal"]

print(sorted(groceries))  # prints ['banana', 'bread", 'cereal', 'milk', 'potato']

print(groceries)  # prints ["bread", "milk", "potato", "banana", "cereal"] (the original order)
```

We can also reverse the items in a list using `reverse()`. If we want the items to be in reverse alphanumeric order, we can use `sort()` followed by `reverse()`.

```python
groceries = ["bread", "milk", "potato", "banana", "cereal"]
 
groceries.sort()
groceries.reverse()

print(groceries)  # prints ['potato', 'milk', 'cereal', 'bread', 'banana']
```

N.B.: When you sort a list, the characters are sorted based on the order of their individual [ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com) characters. In the ASCII chart, all upper case letters come before all lower case letters, so your items may not be in alphabetical order if some begin with a lower case letter and others begin with an upper case letter.

```python
groceries = ["BREAD", "milk", "POTATO", "banana", "cereal"]
 
groceries.sort()

print(groceries)  # prints ['BREAD', 'POTATO', 'banana', 'cereal', 'milk']
```
