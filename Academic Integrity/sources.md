### Generative AI Use 

**In this assignment, you may use generative AI if:**

* You have made an attempt to write the code yourself first.
* You only use AI for debugging purposes once you have written most of the solution.
* Your prompt includes something to the effect of "just give me a hint, don't tell me the answer" to prevent it from giving you the solution.
* You only paste in the code you wrote into the AI tool (not the assignment instructions or the starter code).
* You include your full AI chat history above as a share link or a full-page screenshot.


### Reminders

* It is considered cheating if you paste all or most of the assignment instructions or starter code into a generative AI tool.
* It is considered cheating if you send someone your entire program or let them take a picture of your program.
* It is considered cheating if you copy large amounts of code from your peers or get someone to do all or most of the work for you.
* Each assignment has a file history that indicates when code is pasted in.
* Cheating or lying about your sources (e.g. saying you didn't get help when you actually did) can lead to disciplinary actions.
