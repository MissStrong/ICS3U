## Course Expectations

In this course, you are expected to:

* Complete Google Classroom assignments within their respective Google Docs. Do not work on them in a different word processor (e.g. Microsoft Word) then paste in your answers.
* Complete coding assignments within source code editors in each CodeHS assignment. Do not work on them in a different editor (e.g. VS Code) then paste in your code.
  * Exception: For unit projects, you can ask your teacher for permission to work on them in a different environment.

Cheating in this course includes:

* Pasting all or most of the assignment instructions or starter code into a generative AI tool.
* Sending someone your entire program.
* Letting someone take a picture of your program.
* Copying large amounts of code from your peers
* Copying large amounts of code from an online source.
* Having someone do all or some of the work for you. For example, asking a relative, friend, or tutor to tell you exactly what to write in your program.
* Anyone else typing code in your program. You are the only one typing the code.
* Falsely declaring that you did not get help from someone or an online source.

Cheating in this course does not include:

* Using online sources or generative AI to help you debug code you wrote, as long as you acknowledge them and indicate which lines of code you copied.
* Getting a small amount of help from other people as long as they are not telling you exactly what to write.
* Someone else looking at your code and suggesting verbally how to fix it.
* Working together with a classmate, as long as you are both contributing and not copying from each other.
* Looking at sites like stackoverflow.com for hints, not entire answers.
* Asking the teacher for a hint.
