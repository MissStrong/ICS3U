## README

This folder contains the following:

1. **Course Expectations**. This is the document provided to students before they begin coding to inform them of the expectations surrounding peer help and AI use.
2. **Honour Code**. This is the document that students sign before they begin coding to promise to abide by academic integrity policies.
3. Two versions of **sources.md**. These are the markdown files attached to every exercise on CodeHS for students to complete before they submit the exercise. The v2 is for bonus exercises since generative AI is not allowed at all in these exercises.
