## Sources

### Reminders

* For bonus assignments, **you are not allowed to not get any help from other people or from AI**.
* For bonus assignments, getting help from online sources (**excluding ChatGPT and other generative AI**) is still okay as long as you acknowledge them and indicate which lines of code you copied.
* It is considered cheating if you paste all or most of the assignment instructions or starter code into a generative AI tool.
* It is considered cheating if you send someone your entire program or let them take a picture of your program.
* It is considered cheating if you copy large amounts of code from your peers or get someone to do all or most of the work for you.
* Each assignment has a file history that indicates when code is pasted in.
* Cheating or lying about your sources (e.g. saying you didn't get help when you actually did) can lead to disciplinary actions.
