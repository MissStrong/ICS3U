## CodeHS Student Honour Code

Academic Honesty:

* I understand the meaning and importance of academic honesty. I acknowledge that the following actions will compromise my academic integrity and affect my grade, reputation, and future goals:
* Copying or taking credit for code, either from an online source or a classmate, that is not my own.
* Letting classmates copy my code or answers.
* Posting any solution code online.

Digital Citizenship: 

* I understand that my decisions extend beyond this classroom. I recognize that my words and actions can cause harm to myself or others. I will refrain from:
* Writing inappropriate or offensive messages or code.
* Deliberately disrupting the work of others.
* Abusing my account or classroom equipment.

* I promise to uphold the standards of academic honesty and digital citizenship:
  * I will be responsible for my own work.
  * I will respect the work of others.
  * I will take responsibility for my decisions and actions.

A note on collaboration: In computer science courses, it is usually appropriate to ask others for debugging help or to talk generally about problem-solving strategies and program structure. We encourage discussion and thought-partnering, but do the actual coding on your own.
