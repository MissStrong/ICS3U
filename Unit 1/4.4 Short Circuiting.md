### Short Circuiting

Boolean operators are **short circuited**, meaning a Boolean expression doesn't get fully evaluated if the result is already certain part-way through it.

For example, consider multiplying the numbers in this list: *1, 5, 2, 0, 5, -1, 2*. If we read from left to right, we get 1 × 5 × 2 × 0 ×... and we can stop at the zero because we know for certain that the answer is zero, no matter what the remaining numbers are. We can do something similar with Boolean expressions.

```python
num = 8

if num == 8 or num == 0:  # Python doesn't bother checking num == 0, because the expression is going to be True no matter what
  print("It's 8 or 0.")
else:
  print("It's neither 8 nor 0.")
```

```python
num = 6

if num < 5 and num % 2 == 0:  # Python doesn't bother checking num % 2 == 0, because the expression is going to be False no matter what
  print("It's less than 5 or even.")
else:
  print("It's greater or equal to 4 or odd.")
```

Whenever we have an `or`, the second expression is checked only if the first one is `False`, and whenever we have an `and`, the second expression is checked only if the first one is `True`.

Short-circuiting is useful for preventing errors like dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative.

```python
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if 0 <= num and num ** 0.5 % 2 == 0:  # num ** 0.5 % 2 would raise an error if num is negative, but we can prevent that using short circuiting
  print("It's an even square.")
else: 
  print("It's not an even square.")
```
