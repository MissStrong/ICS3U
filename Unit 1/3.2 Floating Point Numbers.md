### Floating Point Numbers

There are two main ways we can represent numbers in Python: `int` and `float`.

`float` is short for **floating point numbers**. A `float` always has a decimal point.

Examples of floating point numbers: 
* 5.12093
* -1.556
* 0.0
* 38.0
* -189292178.1

### Mathematical Operators

Although integers and decimals are both types of numbers, they are stored differently in Python. When we do operations on numbers, the data type of output will depend of the data types of the numbers we used.

```python
print(8 + 2) # prints 10
print(8.0 - 2.0) # prints 6.0
print(8 * 2.0) # prints 16.0
print(8.0 / 2) # prints 4.0
```

In general:
* `int` and `int` → `int`
* `float` and `float` → `float`
* `int` and `float` → `float`
* `float` and `int` → `float`

### Float Imprecision

Sometimes we get inaccurate answers when we are working with decimal numbers. This is due to **finite data representation**. Python doesn't have an infinite amount of storage and sometimes there isn't enough space to perform a calculation accurately when it involves decimal numbers.

```python
print(39 * 0.2) # prints 7.800000000000001
print(100.1 / 0.4) # prints 250.24999999999997
print (77.4 * 6) # 464.40000000000003
```

One of the strategies to get the exact answer is to use the `round()` function. although we have to be cautious about this. The `round()` function takes two parameters: the number to round and the number of decimal digits to rounds to.

```python
print(round(39 * 0.2, 1)) # prints 7.8
print(round(100.1 / 0.4, 2)) # prints 250.25
print(round(77.4 * 6, 1)) # prints 464.4
```

### Float to Integer

When `int()` takes a decimal number, it doesn't round it to the nearest integer –– it **truncates** the number (i.e. it cuts off the all decimal digits).

```python
print(int(6.8)) # prints 6
print(int(7.9)) # prints 7
print(int(12.0)) # prints 12
print(int(-15.2)) # prints -15
print(int(-19.9)) # prints -19
```
