### Debugging

A **bug** is a general term for an error in a program. Fixing errors is called **debugging**.

Most professional programmers use a **debugger**, which is debugging software designed to **trace** a program to efficiently determine where the errors are coming from. Replit does have a debugger built in, but for now we'll be using a simpler approach.

We can use print statements anywhere within our program. We can use them to debug our code by strategically printing useful information at useful times.

Consider the following program:

```python
num = int(input("Enter a multiple of three or five: "))

if num % 3 or 5 == 0:
  print("Thanks!")
else:
  print("That's not a multiple of three or five...")
```

There are't any red squiggly lines, so there aren't any syntax errors, but when we run the program, we get unexpected outputs.

```
> Enter a multiple of three or five: 3
That's not a multiple of three or five...
```
```
> Enter a multiple of three or five: 4
Thanks!
```
```
> Enter a multiple of three or five: 5
Thanks!
```
```
> Enter a multiple of three or five: 15
That's not a multiple of three or five...
```

Something seems to be wrong with the condition `num % 3 or 5 == 0`. It seems to be `False` when `num` is a multiple of three. That might hint to us that the problem has to do with `num % 3`. Maybe the order of operations isn't what we think it is? Let's slightly modify the condition by putting parentheses around `3 or 5`.

```python
num = int(input("Enter a multiple of three or five: "))

if num % (3 or 5) == 0:
  print("Thanks!")
else:
  print("That's not a multiple of three or five...")
```

```
> Enter a multiple of three or five: 3
Thanks!
```
```
> Enter a multiple of three or five: 4
That's not a multiple of three or five...
```
```
> Enter a multiple of three or five: 5
That's not a multiple of three or five...
```
```
> Enter a multiple of three or five: 15
Thanks!
```

Still not working... What does it think it means `3 or 5` is anyway?

```
> 3 or 5
3
```

Oh... So, it's just completely ignoring the 5. Okay then. The `or` is doing something we don't understand, so let's rewrite the condition without the `or`.

```python
num = int(input("Enter a multiple of three or five: "))

if num % 3 == 0:
  print("Thanks!")
elif num % 5 == 0:
  print("Thanks!")
else:
  print("That's not a multiple of three or five...")
```

This works, but what if we really want to combine the two conditionals into one? In that case, we can combine the two expressions with an `or` in between them.

```python
num = int(input("Enter a multiple of three or five: "))

if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:  # this works perfectly
  print("Thanks!")
else:
  print("That's not a multiple of three or five...")
```

If you are wondering exactly what was happening with `num % 3 or 5 == 0 ` and `num % (3 or 5) == 0`, we'll see these later in this course.
