### Casting

A **type conversion** occurs when a value is changed into a value of a different but compatible type. 

**Casting** is a type conversion that involves using a function to change a variable's data type. In Python, the functions we use have the same name as the data type.

```python
string1 = str(6)  # changes the integer 6 into the string "6"
int1 = int("6")  # changes the string "6" into the integer 6
```
