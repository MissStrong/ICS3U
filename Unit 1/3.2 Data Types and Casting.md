### Data Types

A **variable** is value that can change over time. 

A **constant** is a value that cannot change over time. 

A **data type** is the kind of data that variables and constants can store.

All data types are either primitive or composite. A **primitive data type** (a.k.a. a **basic data type**) represents a single piece of information. If a data type isn't primitive, it is a **composite data type**. Whether a data type is primitive or composite depends on the programming language. Here are the four primitive data types in Python. 

| Data Type | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Integer | Any integer. There is no upper or lower limit to how high or low it can be. |
| Float | Any decimal number that can be represented in 32 bits using [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format#IEEE_754_single-precision_binary_floating-point_format:_binary32). 
| String  | Text.  It consists of individual characters. Strings are enclosed in single quotation marks `'` or double quotation marks `"`. |
| Boolean   | The values `True` or `False`. |

```python
"Miss Strong" # this is a string
-100 # this is an int (integer)
3.14 # this is a float (floating point number)
True # this is a Boolean
False # this is a Boolean
```

We'll be using Booleans later.

### Casting

A **type conversion** occurs when a value is changed into a value of a different but compatible type. 

**Casting** is a type conversion that involves using a function to change a variable's data type. In Python, the functions we use have the same name as the data type.

```python
string1 = str(6)  # changes the integer 6 into the string "6"
string2 = str(6.8)  # changes the float 6.8 into the string "6"
float1 = float("6")  # changes the string "6" into the float 6.0
float2 = float(6)  # changes the integer 6 into the float 6.0
int1 = int("6")  # changes the string "6" into the integer 6
int2 = int(6.8)  # changes the float 6.8 into the integer 6
```

Note that when `int()` takes a decimal number, it doesn't round it to the nearest integer –– it **truncates** the number (i.e. it cuts off the all decimal digits).

```python
print(int(6.8)) # prints 6
print(int(7.9)) # prints 7
print(int(12.0)) # prints 12
print(int(-15.2)) # prints -15
print(int(-19.9)) # prints -19
```
