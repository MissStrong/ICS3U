### Pass

If we try to make the body of a conditional or loop blank, we end up getting an `IndentationError`.


```python
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))

if num > 0:

print()  # This raises an IndentationError
```

```python
while True:

print()  # This raises an IndentationError
```

If we are creating a loop but we want to leave it blank for the time being, we can use the `pass` keyword. This is useful when we are working on several part of a program at the same time.


```python
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))

if num > 0:
  pass # I haven't finished this part yet
```

```python
while True:
  pass # I haven't finished this part yet
```
