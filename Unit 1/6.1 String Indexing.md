### String Indexing

Every character in a string has an **index** (plural: **indices** or **indexes**). The index tells us which position the character is at. The first position is index 0, the second position is index 1, the third position is index 2, and so on.

**In computer science, we often start counting at 0 instead of 1**. Being "off by one" is a common phenomenon when programming.

To extract a specific character in a string, we can use **string indexing**. String indexing involves surrounding the index in square brackets and placing it directly after the string.

```python
s = "abcde"

print(s[0])  # prints a
print(s[1])  # prints b
print(s[4])  # prints e
print(s[5])  # doesn't work since the highest index is 4
```

Suppose we have a long string and we want to extract the last character in it. Instead of manually counting how many characters are in the string, we can use the `len()` function to do that for us.

```python
s = "qwertyuiop[]asdfghjkl;'zxcvbnm,."

print(len(s))  # prints 32
print(s[len(s)-1])  # prints the last character, a period
```

Another option is to use **negative indices**. In Python, we can use negative indices to count backwards from the end of a string.

```python
s = "abcde"

print(s[-1])  # prints the last character, e
print(s[-2])  # prints the second last character, d
print(s[-4])  # prints the fourth last character, b
```
