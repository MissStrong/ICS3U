### Hello World!

When using a programming language for the first time, it is traditional to run a program that prints "Hello World!".

The above image is an example of a Hello World program in Python using Replit. When we hit *Run*, the text "Hello World!" is printed to the console. 

### print()

The most common **function** for printing in Python is `print()`. A function is a command that performs a specific task. The specific task that `print()` does is print text to the console.

Any text we put inside the parentheses gets printed. The text must be enclosed in double quotation marks `"` or single quotation marks `'`, which makes it a **string**. A string is composed of individual **characters**, such as letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and spaces. 

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

The following won't work since the quotation marks are missing:

``` python
print(Hello World!)
```

The error message tells us that something is wrong with the syntax. It doesn't understand that `"Hello World!"` is supposed to be a string since we didn't use quotation marks.

Functions take **parameters**, which are the inputs they need to do their task. Whenever we are providing more than one parameter in a function, we separate them with commas. 

The `print()` function can take take more than one parameter.

```python
print("Hello World!") 
print("Hello", "World!")
```

The `print()` function can also take zero parameters, which causes it to print a blank line.

```python
print("Hello")
print()
print("World!")
```
