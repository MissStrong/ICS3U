### range()

The `range()` function can take one, two, or three integer arguments. Arguments are separated by commas within the parentheses.

When there is one argument, `range()` generates the list of integers from 0 to that number (but not including the number). If the argument is 0 or negative, the list is empty. 

```python
for i in range(10):
  print(i)  # prints the integers from 0 to 9 (doesn't include 10)

for j in range(-4):
  print(j)  # doesn't print anything

for k in range(1.7):  # raise an error since range() takes only integers
  print(k)  
```

When there are two arguments, `range()` generates the list of integers starting from the first number up to the second number (but not including the second number). If the second number is less than or equal to the first number, the list is empty. 

```python
for i in range(0, 10):
  print(i)  # prints the integers from 0 to 9 (doesn't include 10)

for j in range(3, 19):
  print(j)  # prints the integers from 3 to 18 (doesn't include 19)

for k in range(8, 4): 
  print(k)  # doesn't print anything
```
