### Nested Conditionals

When we have a conditional that is placed inside another conditional, this structure is called a **nested conditional**. 

Consider the following conditional:

```python
if 0 < num and num ** 0.5 % 2 == 0:
  print(num, "is an even square")
```

We can make this easier to read by making it a nested conditional instead. The first `if` is forms the **outer conditional** and the second `if` forms the **inner conditional**.

```python
if 0 <= num:  # num can't be negative
  if num ** 0.5 % 2 == 0:  # if the square root is even, num is also even
    print(num, "is an even square")
```

Here's another example of nested conditionals. The `if` on line 1 and `else` on line 7 form the outer conditional whereas the `if` on line 2 and `else` on line 4 form the inner conditional.

```python
if 0 < num:  # num can't be negative
  if num ** 0.5 % 2 == 0:  # if the square root is even, num is also even
    print(num, "is an even square")
  else:
    print(num, "is positive, but not an even square")
else: 
  print(num, "is not positive and not an even square")
```
