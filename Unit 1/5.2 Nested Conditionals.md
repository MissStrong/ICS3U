### Squares and Square Roots

Recall that we can use the operator `**` for exponents. We can calculate the square of a number using `** 2` and the square root of a number using `** 0.5`. You might have already learned in math class about how raising a number to the power of one-half is the square root.

```python
number = int(input("Enter an integer: ))

print(f"{number} squared is {number ** 2}")
print(f"The square root of {number} is {number ** 0.5}")
```

An alternative is to use the `sqrt` function.

```python
print(f"The square root of {number} is {sqrt(number)}")
```

If we want to check whether a number is a square number, we can check whether the square root is a whole number.

```python
number = int(input("Enter a square number: ))

square_root = number ** 0.5

# check whether the square_root is a whole number
```

Here are two common ways to check whether a number is whole number.

```python
if square_root == int(square_root): # the non-rounded version of the number is the same as the rounded version
    print("Thanks!") 
```

```python
if square_root % 1 == 0: # the remainder when you divide by 1 is zero
    print("Thanks!") 
```

### Nested Conditionals

When we have a conditional that is placed inside another conditional, this structure is called a **nested conditional**. 

Consider the following example:

```python
number = int(input("Enter an even square number: "))

square_root = number ** 0.5

if square_root % 1 == 0: # the number is a square
    if number % 2 == 0: # the number is even
        print("Thanks!")
    else: # the number is odd
        print("Close! That's an odd square.")
else:
    print("That's not a square number! :(")
```

The `if` on line 5 and `else` on line 10 form the **outer conditional** whereas the `if` on line 6 and `else` on line 8 form the **inner conditional**.
