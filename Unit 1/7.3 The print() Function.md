### print()

We've been using `print()` to print text to the console. We've seen that `print()` can take many arguments. By default, these arguments get printed with a single space between them.

```python
print("Good", "morning,", "everyone!")  # prints "Good morning, everyone!"
```

We can change what gets printed between each argument by including an a **keyword argument** for `sep`. The keyword `sep` is short for "separator" and its default value is single space `" "`.

```python
print("Good", "morning,", "everyone!", sep = "")  # prints "Goodmorning,everyone!"
print("Good", "morning,", "everyone!", sep = "~")  # prints "Good~morning,~everyone!"
print("Good", "morning,", "everyone!", sep = "--")  # prints "Good--morning,--everyone!"
print("Good", "morning,", "everyone!", sep = "\n")  # prints "Good", "morning,", "everyone!" on three separate lines
```

Another default behaviour is that a newline `\n` is added to the end of each print statement.

```python
print("Good", "morning,", "everyone!")  # prints "Good morning, everyone!"
print("How", "are,", "you?")  # prints "How are you?" on the next line
```

We can change this by including an argument for `end`. The default value of `end` is `"\n"`.

```python
print("Hello", "World", end = "☆\n")  # prints "Hello World☆"
print("Testing", end = "") # prints "Testing "
print("123")  # prints "123" on the same line as "Testing "
```

Another default behaviour is that `print()` prints to the console. We can change it so that it prints to a text file instead, but we'll do that later in this course.

Here is the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) for the `print()` function.
