### input()

The console isn't just for outputting information. Users can type information into the console.

If we'd like to prompt a user for information, we can use the `input()` function. 

In the example below, there are three prompts.

Here's an example of what the console would look like after we answer all three prompts.

Let's look at the code more carefully:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
number = input("Pick a number between 1 and 10. ")
colour = input("What is your favourite colour? ")
```

These three lines contain the prompts. The space before the rightmost quotation marks provide space between the prompt and the response.

**Operators** are symbols used to perform operations or processes. The `=` symbol is called an **assignment operator** and it's used to put a value into a **variable**. In this case, the three inputs are getting stored in the variables `name`, `number`, and `colour`. Although the `=` symbol is what we use for an equal sign in math, this symbol is the assigment operator in Python, not an **equality operator** (we'll see what the equality operator is later this unit).

The purpose of a variable is to store information that we will use later on in the program. We give them helpful names, unlike in math class where we tend to use the letter *x* for almost everything. When we are assigning a value to a variable, we need to put the variable before the `=` and the expression for the value after the `=`. If we swap their positions, the program will raise an error.

```python
input("How old are you? ") = age  # this does not work
```

The line below prints the three responses that were stored into the three variables. Each response is printed with one space in between since that's what `print()` does when there's more than one parameter.

``` python
print(name, number, colour)
```
