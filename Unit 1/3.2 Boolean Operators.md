### Boolean Expressions

A **Boolean expression** is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. The word "Boolean" is named after [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), a logician from the 1800s.

We can create Boolean expressions using various types of Boolean operators. 

### Comparison Operators 

**Comparison operators** are used to compare two values. You might recognize them from your math class. They're also called **inequality operators**.

| Operator Name | Operator Symbol | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Less Than | `<` | |
| Greater Than | `>` | | 
| Less Than or Equal To | `<=` | It's supposed to look like the ≤ symbol. |
| Greater Than or Equal To | `>=` | It's supposed to look like the ≥ symbol |

In Python, we can have more than one comparision operator in an expression.

```python
print(3 < 5) # prints True
print(10 > 50) # prints False
print(7 <= 6) # prints False
print(13 >= 10) # prints True
```

In Python, we can have more than one operator in an Boolean expression.

```python
print(3 < 5 < 10) # prints True because 3 is less than 5 and 5 is less than 10
```

### Equality Operators

**Equality operators** are used to check whether two values are the same.

| Operator Name | Operator Symbol | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Equals | `==` | Mixing up `=` and `==` is a notorious error in computer science. This applies to many programming languages, not just Python. |
| Not Equals | `!=` | It's supposed to look like the ≠ symbol.  |

```python
print(3 == 3.0) # prints True
print(3 == 5) # prints False
print(10 != 50) # prints True
print(10 != 10) # prints False
```

There is a keyword `is` which behaves similarly to `==`, but it does something slightly different. You are encourged to use `==` instead. 

### Boolean Operators

**Boolean operators** are used to modify or combine Boolean expressions. The convention to write the names of Boolean operators in all capital letters. That's why NOT, AND, and OR are in all capital letters.

A **keyword** is a reserved word. In Python, we cannot name variables or constants using keywords. On CodeHS's default colour scheme, keywords turn purple. The words `not`, `and`, and `or` are all examples of keywords.

| Operator Name | Keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NOT | `not` |
| AND | `and` |
| OR | `or` |

We can **negate** a Boolean expression by putting a `not` in front of it. This changes `True` to `False` and vice versa.

```python
number = 12
print(number < 10) # prints False
```

When can are use `and` or `or` to combine short Boolean expressions to make longer ones:

```
mark = 86
print(mark < 0 or 100 < mark) # prints False
```

```
num = 15
print(num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0) # prints True
```
