### Importing Modules

A module is a file that stores a collection of functions, classes (we'll see these later in this course), and global variables. To access these functions, we need to `import` the module. 

```python
import random
```

### The random Module

Python has a module called `random` that can be used to generate **pseudo-random** values. Pseudo-random values are generated at *almost* random. It's extremely challenging for programs to generate perfectly random values, so pseudo-random values are often used.

Here is [the documentation for the random module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). 

### randint()

`randint()` takes two integers and returns a pseudo-random integer greater than or equal to the first integer and less than or equal to the second integer. 

```python
import random

secret_number = random.randint(1, 10) # a random number from 1 to 10
```

### randrange()

`randrange()` returns a pseudo-random integer in the list generated by `range()` with the same arguments. It can take up to three arguments.

```python
import random

secret_number1 = random.randrange(10) # a random number in range(10)

secret_number2 = random.randrange(1, 10) # a random number in range(1, 10)

secret_number3 = random.randrange(1, 10, 2) # a random number in range(1, 10, 2)
```

### choice()

`choice()` takes any sequence data type (e.g. `str` and `range`) and returns a random value in that sequence.

```python
import random

secret_letter = random.choice("abcdef")  # a random letter in "abcdef"
```

If we want to generate a random word, we can store the words in a **list**, which is another sequence data type. Lists begin and end with a square bracket. 

```python
import random

secret_word = random.choice(["banana", "potato", "avocado", "grapefruit"])  # a random food from that list
```

We'll learn more about lists next unit.


### Selective Imports

If we only want to use specific functions from other files, we can use an import statement in the format: `from` filename `import` function. 

```python
from random import randrange # this allows us to write randrange instead of random.randrange

secret_number1 = randrange(10) # a random number in range(10)

secret_number2 = randrange(1, 10) # a random number in range(1, 10)

secret_number3 = randrange(1, 10, 2) # a random number in range(1, 10, 2)
```

If we use the format `from` filename `import *`, it imports all the functions and variables from the file. The asterisk `*` is a **wildcard character**. We should only use this when we are importing only one module so that we can avoid issues with variables and functions from different modules that share the same name.

```python
from random import * # this imports everything from the random module

secret_number1 = randrange(10) # a random number in range(10)
print(sqrt(0))  # prints 0.0
print(sqrt(-4))  # raises an error
```
```
