### Mathematical Operators

Python has the following built-in mathematical operators. We can use them to manipulate and calculate numeric values.

| Operator | Example | New Value of `score` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `=` | `score = 10` | Assigns 10 to the value of `score`. |
| `+`  | `score = score + 2` | Adds 2 to the value of `score`. |
| `-`  | `score = score - 5` | Subtracts 5 from the value of `score`. |
| `*` | `score = score * 2` | Multiplies the value of `score` by 2. |
| `//` | `score = score // 5` | Divides the value of `score` by 5. |
| `**` | `score = score ** 3` | Raises `score` to the power of 3. |
| `/`  | `score = score / 5` | Divides the value of `score` by 5 then takes the dividend. |
| `%` | `score = score % 5` | Divides the value of `score` by 5 then takes the remainder. |

We can put `=` after any of these operators as a shorthand form for update a numeric value.

| Operator | Example | New Value of `score` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `+=` | `score += 7` | Adds 7 to the value of `score`.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score + 7`. |
| `-=` | `score -= 2` | Subtracts 2 from the value of `score`.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score - 2;`. |
| `*=` | `score *= 2` | Multiplies the value of `score` by 2<br><br/> Essentially equivalent to `score = score * 2`. |
| `//=` | `score //= 2` | Divides the value of `score` by 2.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score // 2`. |
| `**=` | `score **= 2` | Raises the value of `score` to the power of 2.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score ** 2`. |
| `/=` | `score /= 2` | Divides the value of `score` by 2 then takes the dividend.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score / 2`. |
| `%=` | `score %= 2` | Divides the value of `score` by 2 then takes the remainder.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score % 2`. |

Although integers and decimals are both types of numbers, they are stored differently in Python. When we do operations on numbers, the data type of output will depend of the data types of the numbers we used.

```
> 8 + 2
10
> 8.0 - 2.0
6.0
> 8 * 2.0
16.0
> 8.0 / 2
4.0
```

In general:
* `int` and `int` → `int`
* `float` and `float` → `float`
* `int` and `float` → `float`
* `float` and `int` → `float`
