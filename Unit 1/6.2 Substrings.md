### Checking Substrings

A **substring** is a smaller string contained in a larger string. For example, `"def"` is a substring of `"abcdefgh"`.

To check whether a string contains a particular substring, we can use the **keyword** `in`. A keyword is a word that a programming language understands. Python knows that `in` can be used to check for substrings.

```python
print("z" in "qwerty")  # prints False
print("erfl" in "butterfly")  # prints True
```

### String Slicing

We can use **string slicing** to extract a substring. The notation for slicing is similar to indexing, except we specify a **start index** and an **end index** separated by a colon. The character at the end index is *not included* in the substring.

```python
s = "abcdefgh"

print(s[0:5])  # prints abcde
print(s[3:6])  # prints def
print(s[4:len(s)])  # prints efgh
```

If we leave the start index empty, the default value is `0`. If we leave the end index empty, the default value is the length of the string.

```python
s = "abcdefgh"

print(s[:5])  # prints abcde, same as s[0:5]
print(s[4:])  # prints efgh, same as s[4:len(s)]
```

We can also use negative indices. Each negative index is treated as their corresponding positive index.

```python
s = "abcdefgh"

print(s[1:-2])  # prints bcdef, same as s[1:6]
print(s[-5:7])  # prints defg, same as s[3:7]
print(s[-6:-3])  # prints cde, same as s[2:5]
```

Whenever the start index is greater or equal to the end index, the resulting substring is an **empty string**. An empty string has a length of zero and is expressed like this: `""`. If we try to print an empty string, it won't print anything.

```python
s = "abcdefgh"

print(s[1:1])  # nothing happens
print(s[6:5])  # nothing happens
print(s[-3:3])  # same as s[5:3], so nothing happens
print(s[7:-3])  # same as s[7:5], so nothing happens
```
