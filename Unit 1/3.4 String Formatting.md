### f-strings

In Python, we can use **string prefixes** to modify the way strings are displayed.

Consider the following line:

```python
print("Welcome, " + name + "!")
```

We can improve the readability by formatting the string using an **f-prefix** (the *f* stands for *format*). To use an f-prefix, we place an `f` in front of the opening quotation mark and enclose variable names in curly braces inside the string.

```python
print(f"Welcome, {name}!")  # this is an f-prefix
```
