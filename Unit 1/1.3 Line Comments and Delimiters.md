### Comments

Comments are used to write words in our program to help explain what is going on to someone reading our code. There are two types of comments: single-line and multi-line. 

* **Multi-line comments** take up multiple lines of code. In Python, they start with `'''` or `"""` and end the same way.

* **Single-line comments** take up only one line of code or one partial line of code. In Python, they start with `#`. These types of comments are typically used to provide a brief decription of what's going on in a particular line of code.

On CodeHS, single-line comments show up in green and multi-line comments show up in blue.

```python
print("Hello World!")  # prints "Hello World!" to the console
```

To change any line into a comment, we can highlight it and do *CRTL + /*.

### Delimiters

A **delimiter** is a symbol that indicates a starting point, a separating point, or an ending point. We've seen these delimiters so far.

* Multi-line comments use `'''` or `"""` as delimiters.
* Single-line comments use `#` as a delimiter.
* Strings use `"` or `'` as delimiters.
* Functions like `print()` use `(`, `,` and `)` as delimiters.
