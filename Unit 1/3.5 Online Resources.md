### Google and Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a platform where programmers can ask questions and get answers. A lot of the time when we are using Google to try to figure out what is wrong with out program or how to do something specific in our program, a Stack Overflow page will be one of the top results.

Using sites like Stack Overflow is okay in this course, **as long as you cite your sources**. It is also expected that whenever you copy/paste code from somwehere that you **write line comments showing that you understand what the code does**.

For example, if we search "python decimal two places", [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/455612/limiting-floats-to-two-decimal-points) is one of the top results. If we scroll down, we'll see people discussing how to use `"{:.2f}".format()`. If we want to use this code in our program, we need to include a line comment explaining what it does. See below for an example.

```python
amount = 5.1
print("{:.2f}".format(amount))  # formats the number to 2 decimal places (5.10)
```

**Tip**: If your program crashes and gives an error message, copy/paste the red error message into a Google search to see what the issue might be. 

### Python Reference

This is the [official reference site for Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/). Everything we can do in Python is documented here. For example, [here is the official page that explains all the data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).
