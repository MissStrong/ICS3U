### Floating Point Numbers

There are two main ways we can represent numbers in Python: `int` and `float`.

`float` is short for **floating point numbers**. A `float` always has a decimal point.

Examples of floating point numbers: 
* 5.12093
* -1.556
* 0.0
* 38.0
* -189292178.1

### Mathematical Operators

Although integers and decimals are both types of numbers, they are stored differently in Python. When we do operations on numbers, the data type of output will depend of the data types of the numbers we used.

```python
print(8 + 2) # prints 10
print(8.0 - 2.0) # prints 6.0
print(8 * 2.0) # prints 16.0
print(8.0 / 2) # prints 4.0
```

In general:
* `int` and `int` → `int`
* `float` and `float` → `float`
* `int` and `float` → `float`
* `float` and `int` → `float`
