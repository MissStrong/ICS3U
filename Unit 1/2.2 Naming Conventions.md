### Naming Conventions

In different programming languages, there are different rules for naming. Here are some of the common notations used.

| Notation Name    | Example                  | Explanation                                                  |
| ---| --- | --- |
| Lower Camel Case       | thisIsLowerCamelCase          | Every word begins with a capital, except for the first word.<br/><br/>All other letters are lowercase. |
| Upper Camel Case      | ThisIsUpperCamelCase         | Every word begins with a capital.<br/><br/>All other letters are lowercase. |
| Snake Case       | this_is_snake_case       | Every letter is lowercase.<br/><br/>Words are separated with underscores. |
| Caterpillar Case | this-is-caterpillar-case | Every letter is lowercase.<br/><br/>Words are separated with hyphens. |

In Python, the convention is to use snake case for variables and functions. 

We'll see lower camel case later in this course when we learn about `class`.

All conventions can be found in the [Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008).
