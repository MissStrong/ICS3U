### Selective Imports

If we only want to use specific functions from other files, we can use an import statement in the format: `from` filename `import` function. 

```python
from random import randrange # this allows us to write randrange instead of random.randrange

secret_number1 = randrange(10) # a random number in range(10)

secret_number2 = randrange(1, 10) # a random number in range(1, 10)

secret_number3 = randrange(1, 10, 2) # a random number in range(1, 10, 2)
```

If we use the format `from` filename `import *`, it imports all the functions and variables from the file. The asterisk `*` is a **wildcard character**. We should only use this when we are importing only one module so that we can avoid issues with variables and functions from different modules that share the same name.

```python
from random import * # this imports everything from the random module

secret_number1 = randrange(10) # a random number in range(10)
print(sqrt(0))  # prints 0.0
print(sqrt(-4))  # raises an error
```
```
