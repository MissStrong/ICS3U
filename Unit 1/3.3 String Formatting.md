### `f`-prefix Strings

In Python, we can use **string prefixes** to modify the way strings are displayed.

Consider the following line:

```python
print("Welcome, " + name + "!")
```

We can improve the readability by formatting the string using an **f-prefix** (the *f* stands for *format*). To use an f-prefix, we place an `f` in front of the opening quotation mark and enclose variable names in curly braces inside the string.

```python
print(f"Welcome, {name}!")  # this is an f-prefix
```

### Format Specifiers

There are many ways we can specify that we want a value to be displayed in a specific way. 

Here is a useful one that rounds to two decimal places and displays both decimal places.

```python
money = 12.3
print(f"${money:.2f}")  # displays $12.30 instead of 12.3
```

The `:` indicates that we're using a format specifier. The `:.2f` means the precision is two decimal places.
