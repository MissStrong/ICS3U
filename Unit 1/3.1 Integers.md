### `int`

`int` is short for **integers**. An `int` can be a positive, negative, or zero, but it cannot have a decimal point.

Examples of integers: 
* 5
* -1
* 0
* 38
* -189292178

### Casting

A **type conversion** occurs when a value is changed into a value of a different but compatible type. 

**Casting** is a type conversion that involves using a function to change a variable's data type. In Python, the functions we use have the same name as the data type.

```python
string1 = str(6)  # changes the integer 6 into the string "6"
int1 = int("6")  # changes the string "6" into the integer 6
```
  
### Mathematical Operators

Python has the following built-in mathematical operators. We can use them to manipulate and calculate numeric values.

| Operator | Operator Name |
| --- | --- |
| `+`  | Addition |
| `-`  | Subtraction |
| `*`  | Multiplication |
| `//` | Division |
| `**` | Exponents |
| `/`  | Integer Division |
| `%`  | Remainder |

We can put `=` after any of these operators as a shorthand form for update a numeric value.

| Operator | Example | New Value of `score` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `+=` | `score += 7` | Adds 7 to the value of `score`.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score + 7`. |
| `-=` | `score -= 2` | Subtracts 2 from the value of `score`.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score - 2;`. |
| `*=` | `score *= 2` | Multiplies the value of `score` by 2<br><br/> Essentially equivalent to `score = score * 2`. |
| `//=` | `score //= 2` | Divides the value of `score` by 2.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score // 2`. |
| `**=` | `score **= 2` | Raises the value of `score` to the power of 2.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score ** 2`. |
| `/=` | `score /= 2` | Divides the value of `score` by 2 then takes the dividend.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score / 2`. |
| `%=` | `score %= 2` | Divides the value of `score` by 2 then takes the remainder.<br><br/>Essentially equivalent to `score = score % 2`. |
