### Boolean Expressions

A **Boolean expression** is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. The word "Boolean" is named after [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), a logician from the 1800s.

We can create Boolean expressions using various types of operators. 

### Comparison Operators 

**Comparison operators** are used to compare two values. 

| Operator Name | Operator Symbol | Example | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Less Than | `<` | `3 < 5` | 3 is less than 5, so the expression is `True`. |
| Greater Than | `>` | `3 > 5` | 3 is not greater than 5, so the expression is `False`. |
| Less Than or Equal To | `<=` | `3 <= 5`	| 3 is less than or equal to 5, so the expression is `True`.<br /> `<=` is supposed to look like the ≤ symbol. |
| Greater Than or Equal To | `>=` | `3 >= 5 `	| 3 is neither greater than nor equal to 5, so the expression is `False`.<br />`>=` is supposed to look like the ≥ symbol |

In Python, we can have more than one comparision operator in an expression. 

### Equality Operators

**Equality operators** are used to check whether two values are the same.

| Operator Name | Operator Symbol | Example | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Equals | `==` | `3 == 5 `	| 3 is not equal to 5, so the expression is `False`.<br/></br>Mixing up `=` and `==` is a notorious error in computer science. This applies to many programming languages, not just Python. |
| Not Equals | `!=` | `3 != 5 `	| 3 is not equal to 5, so the expression is `True`.<br />`!=` is supposed to look like the ≠ symbol.  |

There is a keyword `is` which behaves similarly to `==`, but it does something slightly different. You are encourged to use `==` instead.

### Boolean Operators

**Boolean operators** are used to modify or combine Boolean expressions. The convention to write the names of Boolean operators in all capital letters. That's why NOT, AND, and OR are in all capital letters.

A **keyword** is a reserved word. In Python, we cannot name variables or constants using keywords. On Replit, keywords turn medium blue. The words `not`, `and`, and `or` are all examples of keywords.

| Operator Name | Keyword | Example | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| NOT | `not` |  `not (3 < 5)`	| The statement in the parentheses is `True`, so the expression is the negation of that, which is `False`. |
| AND | `and` |  `(3 < 5) and (3 > 5) `	| At least one of those two statements is `False`, so the expression is `False`. |
| OR | `or` | `(3 < 5) or (3 > 5) `	| At least one of those two statements is `True`, so the expression is `True`. |

We can **negate** a Boolean expression by putting a `not` in front of it. This changes `True` to `False` and vice versa.

```
> number = 12
> number < 10
False
```

When can are use `and` or `or` to combine short Boolean expressions to make longer ones:

```
> mark = 86
> mark < 0 or 100 < mark
False
```

```
> num = 15
> num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0
True
```

The operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and `!=` are also called **inequality operators**.

When we want to check whether a number is between two values, many programming languages require us to create a **compound inequality** using the Boolean operator `and`.

```
> number = 8
> 1 <= number and number <= 10
True
```

However, in Python, we can have more than one inequality operator in an inequality.

```
> number = 8
> 1 <= number <= 10
True
```

```
> x = 3
> y = 3
> x == y == 3
True
```
