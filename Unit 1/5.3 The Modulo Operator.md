### The Modulo Operator

The modulo operator `%` is used to get the remainder when an integer is divided by another integer. It is the same symbol as the percent sign but it has nothing to do with percentage.

```python
print(8 % 5) # prints 3 since 8 รท 5 is 1 remainder 3
print(23 % 5) # prints 3 since 23 รท 5 is 4 remainder 3
```

This operator has a variety of uses and is suprisingly useful in computer programming.

### Multiples and Factors

We can use the modulo operator to determine whether an integer is a multiple or factor of another integer. If `n % m` is `0` then we know that *n* is a multiple of *m* and *m* is a factor of *m*.

```python
print(91 % 13) # prints 0, which tells us that 91 is a multiple of 13
print(56 % 9) # prints 2, which tells us that 56 is not a multiple of 9 but 56-2 is
```

### Last Digits

We can extract the last digits of an integer by using the modulo operator with a power of 10.

```python
print(31415926 % 10) # prints 6 (the last digit)
print(31415926 % 100) # prints 26 (the last two digits)
print(31415926 % 1000) # prints 926 (the last three digits)
```

In general we can extract the last *n* digits of an integer by checking what we get when we do `% 10**n`.

### Integer Test

We can use the modulo operator to check whether a number is an integer by doing `% 1`. The result will be `0` if it's an integer and a decimal number if it's not an integer.

```python
print(314 % 1) # prints 0 because it's an integer
print(314.0 % 1) # prints 0 because it's an integer
print(314.15 % 1) # prints 0.14999999999997726 because it's not an integer
```
