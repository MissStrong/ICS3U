### Flowcharts

**Flowcharts** are diagrams that visually demonstrate an algorithm that involves decision making. Here is an example:

### Flowchart Symbols

There are over 20 standard symbols used in flowcharts, but you only need to know these four for this activity.

| Symbol | Description |
| ---- | ---|
| ![](../Images/1.5.4B.png)<br>Oval | A start or end point. |
| ![](../Images/1.5.4C.png)<br>Diamond | A question being asked. |
| ![](../Images/1.5.4D.png)<br>Rectangle | An action or process. |
| ![](../Images/1.5.4E.png)<br>Arrow | Shows what shape to go to next.<br>Can be accompanied by text. |

### Creating Flowcharts 

Replit has a built-in tool for drawing flowcharts. Create a file with the *.draw* extension to access it.

We can also create flowcharts on Google Docs using the Drawing tool. Go to **Insert>Drawing**, then select the **Shapes** tool. We can drag and drop them onto the drawing area then save the drawing to place it onto the document.

We can also create flowcharts using Microsoft Office software (e.g. Word, Powerpoint, Publisher, etc.) using the **Shapes** tool. 

There are also many free flowchart-making software, such as [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

Drawing them by hand isn't too bad, either.
