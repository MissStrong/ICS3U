### Dictionaries

A **dictionary** is used to store and quickly *look up* "pairs" of information, called **key-value** pairs. Like sets, dictionaries use curly braces `{}` as delimiters. Each **key** and its associated **value** are separated by a colon. 

In the exampe below example, the key `banana` has the value `2`, which tells us that the grocery list says to buy two bananas. 

```python
grocery_list = {"banana": 2, "apple": 5, "orange": 3, "strawberry": 12}
```

Two dictionaries are equivalent if they contain the same key-value pairs. The order they appear in doesn't matter.

```python
dct1 = {1: 10, 2: 20}

dct2 = {2: 20, 1: 10}

print(dict1 == dict2)  # prints True
```

Each key in a dictionary must be unique and can any immutable data type, such as `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `tuple`. A key cannot be a `list`, `set`, `dict`, or any other mutable data type. Values can be any data type.

```python
dct1 = {"a": 10, "b": 20, 30: "c"}  # no error

dct2 = {[1, 2, 3]: 20, 1: 10}  # raises an error
```

A dictionary does not have indices. For example, we cannot get the "first pair", since there is no order to the pairs. However, we can *look up* a key to find its value. To do that, we put the key in square brackets, like an index.

```python
grocery_list = {"banana": 2, "apple": 5, "orange": 3, "strawberry": 12}

print(grocery_list["apple"])  # prints 5

print(grocery_list["pineapple"])  # raises an error
```

### dict()

If we want to initialize an empty dictionary, we can use `{}` or `dict()`. 

```python
groceries = {}  # creates an empty dictionary

groceries = dict()  # also creates an empty dictionary
```

We can also create a dictionary using a list of keys and a list of values.

```python
numbers = dict(zip([1, 2, 3], ["unu", "du", "tri"]))  # zip() does exactly what it sounds like it does
```

There are several other ways to use `dict()` to initialze dictionaroes. They can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict).

### Looping Through Dictionaries

Like lists and sets, dictionaries can be iterated through using a `for` loop.

```python
grocery_list = {"banana": 2, "apple": 5, "orange": 3, "strawberry": 12}

for item in grocery_list:
  print(item)  # prints each fruit one at a time on separate lines
  
for item in grocery_list:
  print(grocery_list[item])  # prints each number one at a time on separate lines
```

Notice that the keys might not be printed in the order you would expect. The order in which the keys are outputted depends on where they are stored in memory, which could be different every time the program is run.

### Modifying Dictionaries

We can add information to dictionaries like this:

```python
grocery_list = {"banana": 2, "apple": 5, "orange": 3, "strawberry": 12}

grocery_list["kiwi"] = 3  # adds "kiwi":3 to the dictionary
grocery_list["grapefruit"] = 1  # adds "grapefruit":1 to the dictionary

print(grocery_list)  # prints {"kiwi": 3, "apple": 5, "orange": 3, "strawberry": 12, "banana": 2, "grapefruit": 1}
```

Here are some other things we can do with dictionaries:

```python
grocery_list = {"banana": 2, "apple": 5, "orange": 3, "strawberry": 12}

print(len(grocery_list))  # prints the number of key-value pairs, which is 4
print("banana" in grocery_list)  # prints True
print("potato" in grocery_list)  # prints False
del grocery_list["orange"]  # removes "orange":3 
print(grocery_list)  # prints the updated grocery list with banana and potato but not orange
```
