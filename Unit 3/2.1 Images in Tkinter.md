### Images in Tkinter

We can place images on a canvas using `create_image()`. The parameters are `x` and `y` (the x- and y-coordinates of the center of the image), followed by the keyword arguments including `image`, which takes a `PhotoImage`. The `PhotoImage()` constructor takes keyword arguments including `file` for the filepath of the image. 

```python
from tkinter import *

# Creates the window and sets the title
window = Tk()
window.title("Doge")

# Sets the size of the canvas
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300

# Creates the canvas for the image to go on
canvas = Canvas(window, width = WIDTH, height = HEIGHT)
canvas.pack()

# Loads the image
doge = PhotoImage(file = "doge.png")

# Puts the image onto the screen
canvas.create_image(WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2, image = doge)

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

To make a `PhotoImage` smaller, we can use the `subsample()` method, which takes a positive integer indicating the scalar factor. Unfortunately there is no way to shrink a `PhotoImage` to specific dimensions other than dividing the width and height by a positive integer. We might have to use separate image editing software to change the dimensions more precisely.

```python
from tkinter import *

# Creates the window and sets the title
window = Tk()
window.title("Doge")

# Sets the size of the canvas
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300

# Creates the canvas for the image to go on
canvas = Canvas(window, width = WIDTH, height = HEIGHT)
canvas.pack()

# Loads the meme image
doge = PhotoImage(file = "doge.png")

# Halves the image's width and height
doge = doge.subsample(2)

# Puts the image onto the screen
canvas.create_image(WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2, image = doge)

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

Unfortunately, `PhotoImage` only supports these image file types: GIF, PGM, PPM, and PNG. If we want to use another image file type, such as JPG, we need a different library. One of the most common image libraries is called `PIL`, short for *Python Imaging Library*.

```python
from tkinter import *
from PIL import Image, ImageTk

# Creates the window and sets the title
window = Tk()
window.title("Doge")

# Sets the size of the canvas
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300

# Creates the canvas for the image to go on
canvas = Canvas(window, width = WIDTH, height = HEIGHT)
canvas.pack()

# Loads the meme image as a PhotoImage
doge = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open("doge.jpg"))

# Puts the image onto the screen
canvas.create_image(WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2, image = doge)

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

With `PIL`, we can also freely modify the dimensions of an image. We first create an `Image`, then we use the `resize()` method, then we create a `PhotoImage`.

```python
from tkinter import *
from PIL import Image, ImageTk

# Creates the window and sets the title
window = Tk()
window.title("Doge")

# Sets the size of the canvas
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300

# Creates the canvas for the image to go on
canvas = Canvas(window, width = WIDTH, height = HEIGHT)
canvas.pack()

# Loads the meme image as an Image, resizes it, and makes it a PhotoImage
doge = Image.open("doge.jpg")
doge = doge.resize((200, 150))
doge = ImageTk.PhotoImage(doge)

# Puts the image onto the screen
canvas.create_image(WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2, image = doge)

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```
