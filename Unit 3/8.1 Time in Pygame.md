### Time in Pygame

Pygame has a `time` module for keeping track of time. It's different from the `time` module in the Python Standard Library. One we initialize Pygame with `init()`, we can use `time.get_ticks()` to see how many milliseconds have passed since `init()` was called. 

This program prints a message to the console about how any milliseconds have passed since the start of the program whenever we left-click the mouse.

```python
# Pygame needs to be imported
import pygame as pg

# Initial setup
pg.init()
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300
screen = pg.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

while True:
    for event in pg.event.get():
        if event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            current_time = pg.time.get_ticks()
            print(f"It has been {current_time} milliseconds since the start of the program.")
    pg.display.update()
```

If we want to know how much time has passed since a particular point, we can keep track of the start and end time and take the difference.

```python
import pygame as pg

pg.init()
screen = display.set_mode((400, 300))

timing = False

while True:
    for event in pg.event.get():
        if event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN
            if timing:  # ensures that it waits until the second click
                previous_time = current_time # updates the time of the second most current click
                current_time = pg.time.get_ticks() # updates the time of the current click
                print(f"It has been {current_time - previous_time} milliseconds since your last click.")
            else:  # this is for the first click
                timing = True
                current_time = pg.time.get_ticks() 
    pg.display.update()
```
