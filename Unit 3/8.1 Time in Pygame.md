### Time in Pygame

Pygame has a `time` module for keeping track of time. It's different from the `time` module in the Python Standard Library. One we initialize Pygame with `init()`, we can use `pg.time`.


We can change the framerate using `pg.time.Clock().tick()`. The default value is 60, but we can set it to a lower number.

```python
# pygame needs to be imported
import pygame as pg

# initial setup
pg.init()
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300
screen = pg.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
clock = pg.time.Clock() # the capital C matters!

# keeps track of a position of the circle on the screen
position = [WIDTH/2, HEIGHT/2]

# keeps the program running
while True:
    clock.tick(30) # changes the frame rate to 30 instead of 60
    # repaints the background to cover up previous circles
    screen.fill("white")
    # draws a circle at the new location
    pg.draw.circle(screen, "green", position, 25)
    pg.event.get() # this line is needed for the key constants to initiate
    pressed_keys = pg.key.get_pressed()
    if pressed_keys[pg.K_LEFT]:
        # moves the position 1 pixel left
        position[0] -= 1
    if pressed_keys[pg.K_RIGHT]:
        # moves the position 1 pixel right
        position[0] += 1
    if pressed_keys[pg.K_UP]:
        # moves the position 1 pixel up
        position[1] -= 1
    if pressed_keys[pg.K_DOWN]:
        # moves the position 1 pixel down
        position[1] += 1
    pg.display.update()
```

We can use `time.get_ticks()` to see how many milliseconds have passed since `init()` was called. 

This program prints a message to the console about how any milliseconds have passed since the start of the program whenever we left-click the mouse.

```python
# Pygame needs to be imported
import pygame as pg

# initial setup
pg.init()
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300
screen = pg.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

while True:
    for event in pg.event.get():
        if event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            current_time = pg.time.get_ticks()
            print(f"It has been {current_time} milliseconds since the start of the program.")
    pg.display.update()
```

If we want to know how much time has passed since a particular point, we can keep track of the start and end time and take the difference.

```python
import pygame as pg

pg.init()
screen = display.set_mode((400, 300))

timing = False

while True:
    for event in pg.event.get():
        if event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            if timing:  # ensures that it waits until the second click
                previous_time = current_time # updates the time of the second most current click
                current_time = pg.time.get_ticks() # updates the time of the current click
                print(f"It has been {current_time - previous_time} milliseconds since your last click.")
            else:  # this is for the first click
                timing = True
                current_time = pg.time.get_ticks() 
    pg.display.update()
```
