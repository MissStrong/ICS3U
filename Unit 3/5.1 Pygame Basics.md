### Pygame

Pygame is a set of custom modules that allows us to display graphics in a window. It was created independently of the inventor of Python. It came out approximately 10 years after Python was first created.

### Pygame.org

The official website for Pygame is [pygame.org](http://www.pygame.org) and the documentation page is [pygame.org/docs](http://www.pygame.org/docs/).

On the documentation page, we can find information about the different constants, variables, and functions we can use.

### Getting Started in Pygame

There are a few lines of code that we need to include in every Pygame program.

```python
# initial setup
import pygame as pg
pg.init()

# size of the screen needs to be a tuple
size = (400, 300)

# sets the window to the size of 400x300 (we can change these numbers if we want)
screen = pg.display.set_mode(size) 

# keeps the program running and updating
while True:
    pg.display.update()
```

1. We first need to import the Pygame module and initialize it. 
2. We then need to create a screen to put the graphics on.
3. Lastly, we need to continuously update the display using an infinite loop. This will keep the program running indefinitely until we press the Stop button.

Here is the result of this program.
