### Text and Fonts in Pygame

When we put text onto a graphic in Pygame, there are several things we have to decide:

* the colour
* the font
* the font size
* any additional styling (i.e. bolding, italics, and underlining) 
* the location on the screen

### Fonts

We can also use any commercial-use font by uploading the .ttf (TrueType Font) or .otf (OpenType Font) file for it. We can use sites like [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com) to legally download these files. Once we download one we can drag it under Files on our project. The contents of the file will look like garbage data, but it isn't!

Now we can load the font into our program using `font.Font()` and apply it using `font.render`.

```python
# Initial setup
import pygame as pg

pg.init()
screen = pg.display.set_mode((400, 300))

# Initializing colours (using RGB values) so we can use them later
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

# Paints the background white
screen.fill(WHITE)

# Stores the font Ephesis with font size 800
'''The parameters of font.Font() are:
- the ttf file of the font
- the font size
'''
ephesis_font = pg.font.Font('ephesis.ttf', 80)

# Stores the text with font styling
'''The parameters of font.render() are:
- the text
- True/False depending on whether you want the text to be smooth
- the colour of the text
'''
text = ephesis_font.render('Hello World!', True, BLACK)

# Places the text at the top-left
'''The parameters of screen.blit() are:
- the styled text
- the rectangle to put the text on
The function get_rect() gets a rectangle sized to
perfectly fits the text. It is located with its 
origin at the screen's origin.
'''
screen.blit(text, text.get_rect())

# Keeps the program running and updating
while True:
  pg.display.update()  
```

Here is the result:

If we want to put the text somewhere else, we can do that by changing the location of the rectangle the the text is on. We can store the rectangle as a variable and change its coordinates.

```python
# Stores the rectangle for the text
text_rectangle = text.get_rect()

# Makes the center coordinate of the rectangle the center of the screen
text_rectangle.center = (200, 150)  

# Places the text on the rectangle on the screen
screen.blit(text, text_rectangle)
```

Here is the same text but in the center of the screen:

There are many other variables to indicate the location of a rectangle.

The following can be assigned a 2-dimensional tuple.

* `topleft`
* `bottomleft`
* `topright`
* `bottomright`
* `midtop`
* `midleft`
* `midbottom`
* `midright`
* `center`

The following can be assigned to an integer, representing either an x-coordinate or y-coordinate.

* `top`
* `left`
* `bottom`
* `right`
* `centerx`
* `centery`

If we want additional styling, we can set the `bold` , `italic`, and `underline` properties of the font to be `True`. By default, they are all `False`.

We need to do these before we render the font.

```python
# Turns bolding on
ephesis_font.set_bold(True)

# Turns italics on
ephesis_font.set_italic(True)

# Turns underlining on
ephesis_font.set_underline(True)
```

Here is the same text as before but with all three additional stylings.
