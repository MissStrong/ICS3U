### Widgets in Tkinter

A **widget** is an individual element of a GUI. Tkinter widgets include labels, buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, scales, dropdown menus, message boxes, and so on.  

When we create these widgets using a constructor, we pass the window and a variety of keyword arguments representing **properties** of the widget.

### The Packing System

Once we create a widget, we still have to place it onto the window. We can do so using the `pack()` method or `grid()` method. We have to pick one of them to use consistently in a program â€“ we can't use `pack()` on some widgets and `grid()` on other widgets in the same program. 

When we use `pack()` with the default window size, the window will take up the minimum size needed to fit the widgets. 

```python
from tkinter import *

# creates the window
window = Tk()

# creates a label for some text to go on
label = Label(window, text="Hello  World!")  # creates the label
label.pack()  # puts the label on the window and adjusts the size of the window accordingly

# keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

If we instead want the window to be a fixed size, we can use the `geometry()` method, which takes a string in the form `"widthxheight"`, such as `"400x300"`. When we do that, we can pick the coordinates of the widget using the `place()` method after we call `pack()`. Properties of the `place()` method include `x` for the x-coordinate and `y` for the y-coordinate.

```python
from tkinter import *

# size of the window
WIDTH = 400
HEIGHT = 300

# creates the window that's 400 pixels by 300 pixels
window = Tk()
window.geometry(f"{WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}") 

# creates a label for some text to go on
label = Label(window, text="Hello World!")  # creates the label
label.pack()  # puts the label on the window
label.place(x=WIDTH/2, y=HEIGHT/2, anchor="center") # puts the label at the center of the window

# keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```
