### RGB Values

All colours that can be displayed on a computer can be expressed using 24 bits. One of the most common ways to express them is using a red-green-blue (**RGB**) value. An RGB value shows how to create the colour using combinations of red, green, and blue light. It is often represented as a **tuple** in which each number is an 8-bit integer ranging from 0 to 255. A tuple is similar to a list, except it uses round brackets and we cannot change its values after we initialize it. We'll learn more details about tuples in Unit 4.

Here are the RGB values of common colours.

| Colour | RGB value       |
| ------ | --------------- |
| Black  | (0, 0, 0)       |
| White  | (255, 255, 255) |
| Red    | (255, 0, 0)     |
| Orange | (128, 127, 0)   |
| Yellow | (255, 255, 0)   |
| Green  | (0, 255, 0)     |
| Blue   | (0, 0, 255)     |
| Purple | (128, 0, 128)   |
| Pink   | (255, 192, 203) |

### Hexadecimal Values

Another common way to express a colour is using its **hexadecimal value**, or **hex value** for short. A colour's hex value can be determined by converting its RGB value. Each of the three individual values can be translated into a 2-digit hex value and we can merge them to get a 6-digit hex value. 

For example, pink's individual RGB values are 255 (#FF), 192 (#C0), 203 (#CB), so pink's hex value is #FFC0CB. The hash symbol `#` is often used to indicate that a string is a hex value.

### Colours in Tkinter

Most functions in Tkinter that take a colour as a parameter can take the colour's hex value. For convenience, we can make constants for the colours we use in our program.

```python
# Initializing colours (using RGB values) so we can use them later
WHITE = "#FFFFFF"
BLACK = "#000000"
RED = "#FF0000"
GREEN = "#00FF00"
BLUE = "#0000FF"
```

The default colour of a window in Tkinter is grey. We can change the colour of the screen using the `.configure()` method on the window and passing the background colour as a keyword argument for `background` like this:

```python
# Initial setup
from tkinter import *
window = Tk()

# Creates a constant for standard blue and sets the background of the window to be this colour
BLUE = "#0000FF"
window.configure(background = BLUE)

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```

Tkinter also recognizes [all these colour names](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TkCmd/colors.html). To use any of them, we just write the name as a string.

```python
# Initial setup
from tkinter import *
window = Tk()

# Sets the background of the window to be the colour called "blue violet" (from the list of recognized colour names)
window.configure(background = "aquamarine")

# Keeps the program running and updating
mainloop()
```
